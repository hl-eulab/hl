What allowed the evolution of our society has not been only the technology derived from the science, but also that technology, perhaps less visible, but certainly equally decisive, that derives from advanced awarenesses of ethics, philosophy, mystic and moral. Beyond the tools for material work, also the habits and the rules are important, and for this reason similar opportunities should be granted them.

<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>

Till now the steps forward for what pertains the most important aspects of our living has been accomplished by persons that must even risk, and not few times lose, their life to affirm their innovating ideas. But today it is not more time of heroisms nor of martyrdoms. Simply we cannot entrust the destiny of our society, our same destiny, to the sacrifices of few heroes.

It is necessary to rationalize the whole process of the social innovation, making it more efficient and productive. Field of research till now grievous and wretched, frequent place of misfortunes, constantly victim of wicked feelings, it is necessary be transformed in a fortunate situation of joy and opportunity of enrichment individual and collective.

<br><br>

An important step in this direction is the creation of a civic place, economical and politic, the social innovations market, where to make possible the meeting among citizens and ideas, in a way that the first have voice to carry to the attention of the organs of government precisely what they more want and require, and in manner that the second could generate a concrete and solid benefit for its ideator.

All our story as human has been a continuous process of refinement. If only yesterday we found the manner to manage, to protect, to make fruit and boost inventions and scientific discoveries, today is necessary we hasten to find the manner to make the same progress with ideas and concepts. In this, Internet will be our precious allied.

<br><br>

So doing, we can claim to have begun to make our society precisely the opposite of what is today: a continuous expression of well-being and happiness to the service of the universal flow.
