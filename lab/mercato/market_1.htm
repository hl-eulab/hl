At the present state of things, the fatherhood of the ideas, that are materializable in concrete objects, is widely protected by the law, and for this reason those who conceived them receive a secure earning. On the contrary, the ideas, that are materializable in a different shape of human organization, are completely NOT protected by the law and for this motive they do NOT grant any earning to those who developed them.

</b></font>

<br><br>

The scientific technology uses a good system of protection, and the innovations of this kind have a wide, flowering and gratifying market. On the other side, the social technology, the whole of rules and procedures relevant to our organization as a society, even having a large and obvious concretization in the mass of persons that are subjected to it, is not protected, and the social innovations have no market where to offer themselves.

<br><br>

<font color="navy"><b>

We need to consider also that at the present time we citizens do not have an indispensable civic place inside which we can operate a sacrosanct act of free choice, where we can reward the single idea of social innovation that we judge good.

</b></font>

<br><br>

This whole of things constitutes a significant deficiency in our democratic regulation that cannot certainly favor, rather: properly hinders, the generation and affirmation of those new, original, lively and brilliant ideas of which our society is in need urgently.

<br><br><br>

<font color="green"><b>

We all should consider the hypothesis to supply the legislative apparatus of our Country with a new place of political intervention through which every citizen can exercise, and use, an effective right, and tool, of direct democracy. 
Precisely, we need that a specific "Social Innovations Market" be founded. We citizens need a place of civil participation in which everyone of us, autonomously, have the faculty:

<br><br>

- to present her/his personal proposals of law,

<br><br>

and simultaneously

<br><br>

- to vote in favor of proposals presented by other citizens.

<br><br>

Those proposals that would meet an established number of adhesions would be automatically conducted to the attention of the Organs of Government for a consideration directed to their promulgation or rejection.

</b></font>

<br><br>

<font color="#800080"><b>

To the purpose to ensure a great participation and of high level, those proposals that would be ratified, should supply their authors the right to be rewarded with an adequate sum of money, in a measure directly proportional to the spread and usefulness of the their intervention, as well as to the depth of the beneficial change caused in the society.

</b></font>

<br><br><br>

<font color="navy"><b>

To the purpose to guarantee a protection of the proposals presented, we should study and approve an appropriate exception in the field of the normative on the protection of the intellectual property, so that a "social patent" could be released to those ideas, presented to an appropriate Office of the Market, that, by paraphrasing the main rules of the industrial patent:

<br><br>

- have relevance with the social order,<br>
- can be applied in legal field,<br>
- have a necessary requirement of novelty,<br>
- rise from a specific inventive activity,

<br><br>

not resulting therefore in obvious manner from the state of the current social technology.

</b></font>

<br><br>

<font color="green"><b>

Naturally this social patent would serve only to guarantee a reward by the State in case the State will use the presented proposals. In no way the social patent will limit instead the spread of ideas.

</b></font>

<br><br><br>

If we understand the importance of the mechanism of the concession of a fair prize, inside a system aimed to find those solutions necessary to satisfy our enormous present problems, we also understand that, in case this same proposal wishing a "Social Innovations Market" will result satisfactory the above mentioned requirements of the "social patent", and will be subsequently approved becoming operative in this Country, a sum of two cents of US dollar, or equivalent, for every citizen of this State will appear well spent, to be assigned therefore to its author, the Laboratory of Social Research Eudaemony, like right reward for its work.

<br><br>

Being this both a case study, an example, and an act morally to be made in order to advance request that identical possibility be granted to every other person.
