  The Social Innovations Market 
----------------------------------
  From the marsh of the politics
  to the peaks of the excellence 



Let us imagine to have a place of civil participation where a simple citizen can exercise a shape of very special direct democracy, being able, by alone, to present one or more proposals relevant to the legal regulation of his Country. 

And let us imagine too that, in this same place of political intervention, everyone have the faculty to express directly himself in favor of those proposals, presented by other citizens, that excite him, being able to leave in an unknown darkness the other. 

Let us imagine, finally, that a rich reward would be assigned to who would have conceived a new social technology that would be at last approved by the Government. That in order to obtain a thick and fascinated participation, above all very stimulated to conceive interventions of always growing quality. Nothing to do with the sad contributions, with the cunnings, that today come from the political parties that, however act, remain always on the top, because no other choice is expected. On the contrary we imagine interventions containing genuine ideas, whose qualitative level raise more and more just for the selection operated from the same citizens. 

To a certain point, those proposals, that would met the favor of an established number of persons, automaticly would be lead to the attention of the traditional Organs of Government for a consideration directed to their promulgation, after an adequate improvement, or to a rejection. Being such organs held, however went the things, to lead a study, and to deliver a relation on the matter in object. 

It would be wonderful to have such an interesting opportunity, and the wide offer, high in quality and novelty, that typically arises from the possibility of an adequate prize. 

Here we dare to imagine all that, thinking that such an innovation would allow to integrate the oligarchyc representative shape of our present structure, still only vaguely democrat, with a popular direct participation active and rich, that in the rewarded creativity will find a powerful evolutionary engine for our society. 


Already for a lot of time, when we need, or simply we wish, a material object, in order to get it we go in some shop. Here we look ourselves around, we ask information, we verify which are the various possibilities, even granting us to delay the purchase to a successive date to have the opportunity to know better the matter and to reflect before to buy. After that, when we have decided, we return at the market to buy the object, we pay it, and we carry it at home, beginning immediately to enjoy the benefits that it introduces in our life. 

Well: does it exist a reason for which this same system based on the free personal choice cannot be used to obtain the single elements of that intangible whole of tools that is our legal regulations? Our reply is: no, we think that no obstacle exists to this. 

We cannot forget in fact that our system of government does not offer us, already for long time, the possibility to make a real choice. The politicians do not differentiate themselves one from the other, and their ideas and proposals now lack of a true value. We can say that, more than to live in a democratic regulation, we are submitted to a true shape of oligarchy, a government of few that badly treat the many. 

Let us try, only for a moment, to think to the horrifying hypothesis that also in the field of the material objects we would be submitted to a productive system having the same rules of our system of government. How it could be the quality of a refrigerator, of a car, of a computer, of a wine, of a bread, of any product that would made by brands and firms that are planned and work in the way are planned and work the political parties? 

Beacause this is the point! What kind of refrigerator do you think you would have without having ever had any real possibility of choice? What kind of product we could have if we do not have that mechanism that let us put our money with precision in the pockets of those who did a good work, in the meantime avoiding ourselves to distribute money to a crowd of incapables? Only a scrap, only a debris, we could extract from a system of this kind! 

Let us think, then, that for the laws, the regulations, the rules, the drawings, the projects, the technologies, the procedures of those structures that hold us together, that give us a social shape, could happen justly so. Today we delegate ALL our power to who is so ambitious and proud to think to be able to represent us. For ourselves, we maintain only the power to choose this or that presumptuous, while other and more precise and suitable act of choice still lacks. 

Today we continue to pay politicians (immersed in a system based on continuous exchanges of favors, that cannot but ruin all that it approaches) paying them always, whatever be the results of their "work". On the contrary, we have no possibility to propose, to choose and to reward the single intervention, not having the way to boost quantity and quality of the offer. This system can generate only meager products, something that in a market based system not ever will be seen. 

On the contrary, let us try to imagine what we could obtain if those same human qualities and skills that make possible such a lot and incredible successes in the world of the science and of the industrial technology, if those same genialities that generate so many masterpieces in the field of the art and of the show, if those same gifts of courage and tenacity that allow so high performances in the sport and adventure would be used to make evolve our society! Continues discoveries, fascinating wonders and increasing records also in the field of the social evolution: this is what we would get! 

Because: what is that produces discoveries, masterpieces and records? Yes, it is an attitude and a passion intrinsic to the person, but it also and mainly is the possibility to receive an adequate prize at the end of so many toils. 


Fair rewards then we should offer to whoever will use his fervor to supply us with the tools to go outside from the nauseating marsh in which we are fallen. Considerable rewards be granted to those who they will use their geniality to transform this obscene film of horror of lowest category in an exciting film of adventure and of love of first order, with an happy, very happy end. 

Far from invoking a change of excessive weight, quite aware that elsewhere competitiveness, market and private should go instead abundantly reduced, simply directed to establish a balance in our system of government with the introduction of a valid tool of democratic participation, mainly wishing to open a good, wide way for the social innovation, at present time shamefully compelled to the exile for life, we wish the birth of an indispensable and urgent Social Innovations Market.
