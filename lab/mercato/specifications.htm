If the hypothesis to found a social innovations market could be valid, certainly a multitude of books will be written to examine in detail the places, the times, who and how will be part of this new, exciting and fruitful tool of social evolution. Here we limit to trace through large lines its construction, in a manner however sufficiently defined that representives of the various interested specializations can happily carry out it.

<br><br><br><br>

First, we need to consider the legal side of the Social Innovation Market. To the present state of the things, there are various kinds of protection for the products of the intelligence. Generally, all what it is carried out in a material object can be protected through a patent (if relevant to scientific technology and industrially reproducible) or is however protected through the copyright (if relevant to the culture or the art).

<br><br>

On the contrary, ideas and concepts today are not protected, to the purpose to favor their spread. For a similar purpose of free access to the information, laws, orders, official actions and other documents emitted from the public administrations are not protected with copyright.

<br><br>

In the case we would establish a system of rewards for the authors of those reforms that would be accepted by the society, we need to extend a kind of patent to those ideas that, by paraphrasing the necessary conditions to the release of an industrial patent,

<br><br>

- have relevance with the social order,

<br><br>

- can be applied in legal field,

<br><br>

- have a necessary requirement of novelty,

<br><br>

- are born in a specific inventive activity, not resulting therefore in obvious manner from the present state of things.

<br><br>

<b>

Such new kind of patent would be directed only to guarantee a financial return to its owner by the State, in the case the State would use his proposal. It would be necessary therefore to found an office for the protection of the social innovation, precisely: a Social Patent Office, with an Archive containing all the presented proposals satisfying the abovementioned requirements.  

<br><br>

<font color="green">

These proposals would not enjoy instead of any protection through the copyright, in a way that the possibility to spread the ideas will remain unchanged. The new "social patent" would ensure only the right to be potentially rewarded for those who would have engaged theirselves to improve their society.  

</font>

</b>

<br><br><br><br>

Naturally the Social Innovations Market needs a physical and virtual place (physical mainly for the management, on line mainly for the public access) where to show the rules that discipline the market and the products of the human intelligence directed to improve and to make more attractive and powerful, healthier and fruitful, our social organization.

<br><br>

The presentation of the proposals, possible for single citizens and for cooperating persons, can happen continuously, in any moment, by paying an accessible sum for the expenditures of procedure and of maintenance of the file in the archive.  

<br><br>

Once satisfied the preliminary examination of conformity to the requested specifications, the innovation can be archived and exhibited in public in the most indicated section for typology.

<br><br>

<b>

In its own market, the social innovation will have the possibility to be voted, literally "buyed", from a number of persons (defined when this new democratic place of expression is founded) sufficient to the aim to be considered by the Government for a conclusive and decisive evaluation.  

</b>

<br><br><br><br>

The use of the Social Innovations Market naturally should be promoted from the same State, being a tool of leading importance for the exercise of the direct democracy.

<br><br>

For the spread of the innovative idea, no publicity for payment can be used, because this would distort the value of the proposals.  

<br><br>

The authority that should collect, examine and manage the proposals naturally should have an harmonic rotation of its organic, otherwise its personnel will not be reliable.
