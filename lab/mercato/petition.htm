<br><br>

while the fatherhood of the ideas that are materializable in concrete objects by the industry is widely protected by the law, and for this reason those who conceived them receive a secure earning,

<br><br>

on the contrary the important ideas that guide the life of the human beings are completely NOT protected by the law, and only for this reason they do NOT grant any earning to those who conceived them,

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">considered therefore that:</span></font>

<br><br>

while the scientific technology uses a good system of protection, and the innovations of this kind have a wide, flowering and gratifying market, on the other side the social technology, the whole of rules and procedures relevant to us human beings as a society, even having a large and obvious concretization in the mass of persons that are subjected to it, is not recorded by the law, and the social innovations have no market where to offer themselves;

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">considered too that</span></font>

<br><br>

at the present time we citizens do not have an indispensable civic place inside which we can operate a sacrosanct act of free choice, where we can select and reward the single idea of social innovation that we judge good,

<br><br>

this whole of things constitutes a significant deficiency in our democratic regulation that cannot certainly favor, rather: properly hinders, the generation and affirmation of those new, original, lively and brilliant ideas of which our society is in need urgently,

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">the signed citizen</span></font>

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">courteously pray you</span></font>

<br><br>

to consider the hypothesis to supply the legislative apparatus of our Country with a new place of political intervention through which every citizen can exercise an effective right, and tool, of direct democracy.

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">Precisely he asks</span></font>

<br><br>

you strive in order a specific Social Innovations Market be founded, a place of civil participation in which every citizen, autonomously, have the faculty:

<br><br>

- to present her/his personal proposals of law,

<br><br>

and simultaneously

<br><br>

- to vote in favor of proposals presented by other citizens.

<br><br>

Those proposals that would meet an established number of adhesions would be automatically conducted to the attention of the Organs of Government for a consideration directed to their promulgation or rejection.

<br><br>

To the purpose to ensure a great participation and of high level, those proposals that would be ratified, should supply their authors the right to be rewarded with an adequate sum of money, in a measure directly proportional to the spread and usefulness of their intervention, as well as to the depth of the beneficial change caused in the society.

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">Simultaneously he asks that</span></font>

<br><br>

to the purpose to guarantee the attribution of a paternity to the proposals presented, should be studied and approved an appropriate exception in the field of the normative of the intellectual property, so that a "social patent" could be released to those ideas, presented to an appropriate Office of the Market, that, by paraphrasing the main rules of the industrial patent:

<br><br>

- have relevance with the social order,<br>
- can be applied in legal field,<br>
- have a necessary requirement of novelty,<br>
- rise from a specific inventive activity,

<br><br>

not resulting therefore in obvious manner from the state of the current social technology.

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">Considered finally</span></font>

<br><br>

the importance of the mechanism of the concession of a fair prize, inside a system devoted to find the solutions necessary to satisfy our problems and the opportunities of further development and evolution,

<br><br>

<font color="white"><span style="background: #0080c0">I declare right now that</span></font>

<br><br>

in case this same proposal auspicating a "Social Innovations Market" will result satisfactory the above mentioned requirements of the "social patent", and will be subsequently approved in order to become operative in our Country, a sum of two cents of dollar (or equivalent) for every citizen will appear to me well spent, to be assigned therefore to its author, the Laboratory of Social Research Eudaemony, like right reward for its work.

<br><br>

Being this an act morally to be made in order to advance request that identical possibility be granted to the undersigned, like to every other, citizen.

<br><br>

Grateful for your attention,
