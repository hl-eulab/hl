Such a situation, heir of worse periods, cannot but to continue to breed a climate of contrast, of struggle, of suffering, of frustration, of dissatisfation, of continuous defeat, and the intervention in social field, instead to be a joyful and resolving activity, remains a sad and unlucky intellectual place.

<br><br>

<b>

And in fact the better creatives among us, those minds that excel in various capacities, that have full conscience of their own value and seek a field where to express their genius with profit, do not let themselves to be involved in the process of social change. Which talentuous person can be so crazy to accept to do an activity extremely expensive in time and energies to analyze, to study and to synthesize valid social innovations, by knowing that will not have the way to effectively propose them and even less to gain something?

</b>

<br><br>

And we cannot forget the typical route of the ideas, of the innovative sights. First being ignored, then opposed, to a certain point, if valid, they are commonly accepted till the point to swiftly become considered banal. The reward to the person that would have succeeded to propose them and that, working with enormous engagement, would have succeeded in some endured manner to see them realized, would inevitably follow equal destiny, in the meanwhile having acquired also it a banal, slight, worthless value, reducing itself to a little sterile glory.  

<br><br><br>

It is not a case that today also most of the artists and of the persons of culture, living of their work, prefer to remain clutched to the currents of dominating thought, firmly avoiding to exceed the confine of an omnipresent, well paid, entertainment and to graze some authentic, justified, resolver, but not payed, innovative proposal.

<br><br>

The wish to live in a better society cannot being enough to make they have an objective, intense and effective participation, at least until the moment in which we will find ourselves all in such a deteriorated situation that the salvation will become gratifying at least as much, if not more, as a financial reward.  

<br><br>

In the meanwhile, crowds of experts and professionals will gain wealth more and more by amusing themselves with our problems, happy to have made them chronic and therefore their inexhaustible source of earning.
