If we consider the exasperations in the field of the traditional industrial patent, we can have fears listening about the desire of the founding of a "social" patent. Nothing however that does not fall automaticly once made some specifications.

<br><br><br>

The consignees of the traditional patent are one or more industrial producers. In such multiple situation, the patent attributes to its official owner a sort of monopoly of the exploitation of the technical invention in order to extract the greatest gain.

<br><br>

On the contrary the consignee of a social patent would be a sole entity: the State. For "social innovation" here we do not mean in fact some shape of new social enterprise, or initiative, started by private citizens, for example like those for the microcredit. It would be perfectly comprehensible the rise of a strong opposite feeling, if someone would think to put limits to this idea or to its application.  

<br><br>

The wished social innovations market would contain instead only proposals relating the codified whole of rules that hold united the persons inside a community, practically what contributes to structure the State.  

<br><br><br>

While the industrial patent have an hindering action in the use of the technical invention, the social patent would not hinder anything, by attributing to its owner the only right to receive an earning by the use that his Country, first for positive expression of the community and then of the same Government, would decide to do of its social invention.

<br><br>

The social patent, practically relating our organization as society, would consist in a pure and simple attribution of fatherhood of the idea. It would have only function of guarantee of a prize for the author and no counterindication for the community.  

<br><br><br>

The social patent would not limit then in some manner the spread of the ideas. The relevant Office rather having to inform the citizenship of all the new presented and accepted proposals.

In order to make more clear, we present three concrete examples:
