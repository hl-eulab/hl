There are many reasons for which the things in the world go badly. Among the most important, there is the fact that our societies are organized in such a manner that it is not possible to draw an adequate income from the presentation of valid solutions for their improvement.

<br><br>

We humans are evolved enormously in a technological ambit: we went on the Moon, we communicate easy on the net, we fly high in the skies, we transplant organs like if we moved coins from a pocket to another one, and so on. But the same thing we cannot say for what pertains the general course of our societies, their painful, often tragic, situations being widely and daily documented from the media.

<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>

Why our technological level surpasses so much the level of our social evolution?  

</b></font>

<br><br>

Absolute truths do not exist, nevertheless we can quietly assert that one of the main motive of this state of things consists in the following opposite situation:

<br><br>

<b>

- while the fatherhood of the ideas that carry out themselves in material objects is widely protected by the law, and for this reason those who conceived them get a secure earning,

<br><br>

- the ideas that carry out themselves in a different shape of human organization are completely NOT protected by the law and for this reason do NOT lead any earning to those who developed them.

</b>

<br><br>

While the scientific technology enjoys a good system of protection, and the innovations of this kind have a wide, flourishing and gratifying market, the social technology, the whole of rules relevant to our organization as a society, even having a large and obvious concretization in the mass of persons that make use of it, it is not protected, and the social innovations have no market where to offer themselves.

<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>

It is just this state of things, the lack of a protection, of a market and of an economical benefit, that contributes to hold distant from the area of social intervention the more beautiful, creative and sparkling minds of our community, in the meantime making impossible the presentation and affirmation of elegant and functional ideas for the lack of a direct line between the single political proposal and the citizenship.
