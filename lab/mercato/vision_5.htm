A society that wants to live well needs, like any other organism, of an equilibrated structure. If it is true that in this historical period the conventional economy is heavily unbalanced in favor of the private economy, that contributes to create the sad situation in which we live, it is also true that the whole ambit of the social, legal, governmental, constitutional, innovation is an activity that does not benefit at all of that decisive stimulating situation that so much make advance the scientific technology and the other economic processes: the market, the possibility to sell goods together other of the same kind, the better one being able to get a prize adequate to its value.

<br><br>

<font color="green"><b>

While in the whole conventional economical ambit it is necessary to restore an equilibrium in favor of the public economy, also leading within the sphere of the public activity those that has been wrongly, unhappily privatized, for what regards the offer of social innovation it should be rebalanced, therefore liberalized and opened to the private citizens, granting them the possibility to concretely participate, to offer their contribution and in the case to have it rewarded.

<br><br>

Also, while it is urgent to dilute an exasperated local and global competition than by now seems literally a struggle body to body, it is also the time to free from its present oligarchic regimen the system of the social innovations, giving it finally a healthy stimulating competition.

It is good that the laws of protection of a work, for example like those of the copyright, or of an invention, like those on the industrial patent, be maintained within certain limits, that do not surpass the legitimate desire of an author, or of an inventor, to be rewarded for his works and toils. But it is also good to consider excessive the fact that a new drawing, a new project, a new vision of the society and of our same life, that therefore influences our legal corpus, do not have any protection and do not have a circuit where to be presented and literally gained from the citizens, with a nourishing benefit for who has worked.

A person should have interest to contribute to improve her society, not to deteriorate it. Who makes, or would make, the work of social innovator should have the possibility to have his proposal rewarded in a measure directly proportional to its spread and usefulness, as well as to the depth of the change obtained, once it would have been applied.

<br><br>

It is not wise that in all the fields of human activity, not only in those more useful but also in those to simple purposes of fun, like in the show and in the sport (and even in the alea), even excessive rewards are expected, while just there where arise those ideas that plan our thought and life like individuals and like a society, in the practice all is leaved to lobbies of power that operate not on the base of sharable values but moved from their ristrected interests.
