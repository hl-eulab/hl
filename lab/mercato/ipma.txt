

Kind Editor of the Intellectual Property Marketing Advisor,

I send you my best and most respectful regards.

I am here to present the hypothesis of the opening of a new market in the field of the intellectual property.

I pray you to let me present a propositive synthesis:

1) we can observe that any citizen can acquire in a special office an industrial patent in order to protect an idea that could be materializable in concrete objects;

2) we observe too that this protection, for the earnings that it permits, favors a continuous, enormous, swift technological development;

3) we can hypothesize then the birth of a specific "social patent": this new governmental institution, even not limiting in any way the spread of the ideas on the contrary favouring it through special spaces on the media, could grant identical opportunity of earning to the authors of those proposals of sociopolitic innovation, of new laws, motions, common rules, that, being first presented in a special office, would then be voted by citizens inside a specific "social innovations market", and eventually finally ratified by the traditional authorities of Government.

I think that this special institution could favor a great development and an high evolution of our societies, and consequently of their culture and patrimony of ideas, of the same level and quality of those that for long time had the industrial technology.

I report the link at the website of this initiative:

I hope it could be of interest and presented on your publishings.

Very respectfully and gratefully,
