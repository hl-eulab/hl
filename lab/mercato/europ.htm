A prayer for a<br>
Direct Democracy<br>
European Institution<br>

</i>

<br><br><br>

Kind Euro Parliamentar,

<br><br>

I send you my best regards.

<br><br>

I dare present myself to you with a prayer: please, help European peoples to have an international official agorà where they can present the fruits of their political/social sensibility and creativity inside an European ambit. Specifically I dare present you a revolutionary project that I think would give enthusiasm and love for Europe to every man and woman on its territory: an European Rewarded Permanent Popular Assembly.

<br><br>

In few words: 

<br><br>

1) we observe that any citizen can acquire in a special office an industrial patent in order to protect an idea that could be materializable in concrete objects; 

<br><br>

2) we observe too that this protection, for the earnings that it permits, favors a continuous, enormous, swift technological development; 

<br><br>

3) we hypothesize then the birth of a specific "socio/politic patent" that, even not limiting in any way the spread of ideas on the contrary favouring it, could grant identical opportunity of earning to the authors of those proposals of social innovations, new laws, directions, that, being first presented in a special office, would then be voted by citizens inside a specific "SocioPolitic Innovations Market", and eventually finally ratified and rewarded by the traditional authorities of Government. 

<br><br>

In this way I think that an equal development can be favored to the today tragically ancient organizations of our societies and contemporaneously to our cultures and patrimony of ideas of the same quality and level of the development that for long time have our industrial technology. If our progress is today often stopped and prevented by lining up ourselves in "political forces", by resorting to our same "political intelligences" may be would help us over every imagination.

<br><br>

This project is more extensively presented at:

<br><br>

Well: would you very kindly help it to become a concrete and working reality?

<br><br>

My warmest thanks for your precious attention,

<br><br><br>
