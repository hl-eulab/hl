Delighted to hear from you, Danilo. Too bad I didn't know 
about you this summer when I spent time in Thiene visiting 
my aunt and uncle. Perhaps you have heard of Luigi 
Meneghello, the author of Libra Nos a Malo.

I'm glad you mentioned experimens with rodents. I have 
often thought of the anology of too many rats in a limited 
space as a perfect analogy to our  condition. I should be 
happy to hear of any findings you come up with.

On the theoretical question of getting others to see our 
point of view, to me, it's a slow process of widening our 
audience. Recently I've come to see the main problem of overpopulation 
effectively working against us by building walls against 
our message.

Meanwhile I am very happy to add you to the DESIP list.

Ronald

Dear Mr. Ronald Bleier,

I send you my best regards and many thanks for your very useful work to
protect human race and our Planet from a greater overcrowding!

I'm an italian social researcher. I have prepared a WEB site directed to
italian people in which furnish information on overpopulation issue. Now I
wish integrate the present matter with a documentation on the overpopulation
behaviour and biological effects on human beings or on other living beings.

I have found only notice on a book on some researches made by John B.
Calhoun, a psychologyst of the National Institute of Menthal Health, that
has made experiments with mice (Universe 133). But I have found nothing on
the WEB that I can utilize in my overpopulation web site to sensibilize
people about the true origin of great part of their stress.

Can you address me to something like this?

Receive my great thanks in advance, have great days,

Danilo D'Antonio
