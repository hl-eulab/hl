Kind Mr. Andrew Baynes,

many thanks for your precious efforts in building a better world!

We are a little Italian laboratory of global researches and the environment
is at the first place in our list of concerns. We are very interested in
your activities, and for this reason, we would be very happy if you could
add our e.mail:

x(at)yinker.com

to your newsletter or mailing list.

Probably, you are interested in overpopulation themes, like we are, so we
send you the call below for the determination of an optimal local
demographic density on the European territory.

We heartily hope to meet your adhesion and contribution in this initiative
and to keep in touch each other.

Receive our best greetings, thanks for all in advance,

Marinella Castiglione

Call
to the European Political Forces
and Governmental Organizations
for the determination
of an optimal local demographic density.




Kind Madame, kind Sir,

We send you our warmest greetings!


As you certainly know, in the last few months the world's population has
reached and exceeded the amount of six billion units, that of India having
exceeded one billion. These facts, although they represent a serious
demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and extreme care, have
not been treated with the necessary attention by the general public. Even
the people and groups most socially committed are almost all indifferent to
that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most serious social
illnesses of our era. 

With the purpose of encouraging debate and awareness of a theme that
urgently calls to be examined attentively, the issue has been condensed
under the form of a Resolution of Interest and other material published on
an Internet site activated specifically for this purpose with the related
International Forum of reflection and action. (Address below).

Imagining that you, like us, are also feeling these same impulses of healthy
personal involvement, we permit ourselves to contact you at this point in
the hopes that you will want to treat this theme within your Group and in
the administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far from being an issue
that relates only to places far from our Nations, this demographic problem
has, in fact, for some time and in the general unawareness, fully expressed
itself also within those Nations, even made worse by heavily industrialized
ways of life. 

And in effect, observing the average of the European Union, we remember that
(according to data of 1997) the population density of the whole territory is
of 127 individuals per square kilometer, that means that every European,
ideally dividing the territory of our Union, has at his disposal an area of
only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1) from which to get his life needs (note
2) and on which to enjoy his individuality and to express his creative
power. 

It is rather complex to determine through a scientific method a total
optimal inhabiting density or the highest reasonable for a society, and to
establish how many individuals a territory can support without degrading
itself; however, with the simple comprehensive view we get by living this
situation personally, it is easy to understand that we have already for some
time exceeded a certain threshold of psychophysic wellbeing and healthiness,
and also of sound economic indipendence, since the European's life, their
territory no longer being enough to satisfy the exigencies of a widely
excessive population, by now depends much more from other zones of the Earth
than from Europe itself. 

For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the current
phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from external
overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is right that the
international demographic issue should be faced at, and should receive
contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed, made clear and
decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of overnational and world
political forces, being the problem of a planetary burden, but also in a
local ambient, at a national, regional and even provincial level, observing
both right and duty, as the demographic issue manifests itself also locally
and can find also locally effective solutions. 

In particular and to begin, it would be more than opportune to start a
diligent multidisciplinary study on the demographic situation, in every
Region and Nation, on the effects, not at all positive, that the local
overpopulation, not only urban but also rural, produces on the individuals
themselves, on the society and the environment. In this way it could be
finally possible to attribute a more precise responsibility to many of the
problems, still with a vague paternity, that worry us today, and to present
them the solutions they are waiting for. In the same time it would be
extremely auspicable to make clear in what measure we are real children of
our land and in what other we are instead dependent on far zones of the
world, in order to try to re-establish, with time, a sound equilibrium
between these two economic modalities (note 3). 

From this study immediately it would emerge that our present demographic
density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals and that a
further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous motives:
restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would
ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In this
case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an optimal
number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual, the
society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the whole
European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our errands of
present management and plans of future development (note 4). 

Also aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would
involve, we believe that the local and planetary situations demand an
immediate and intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that
this engagement of self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to
our Nations, but would also furnish an important point of reference both to
the less developed Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of
population, and to the other more developed, generally affected, like we
are, by hyperurbanization, both being still immersed in the torpor,
distracted and undecided on which direction to take. 

For all this, we hope that the demographic issue will rise powerfully to the
attention of our consciences and soon become theme of wide local debate, and
similarly we hope the study here augured will soon become concrete reality
(note 5). 


Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking you deeply for your courteous attention, and
auguring ourselves that this initiative of ours, though modest, has met with
you some degree of consensus, we extend to you our best wishes. 


Danilo D'Antonio

NOTES

1)	For a brief comparison, and starting with our Country: an Italian
(national average) has at his disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area
much smaller than everyone would wish to, and be opportune to, have at his
disposal. In this heavy, sad situation Italy finds inside the European Union
crowded companions in Germany (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42 hectares
per person), in England (243 inhabitants per square Km - 0.41 hectares per
person), in Belgium (310 inhabitants per square Km - 0.32 hectares per
person), and in Holland (457 inhabitants per square Km - 0.21 hectares per
person). The European average is: 127 inhabitants per square Km, equal to
0.78 hectares per person; the world average is: 44 inhabitants per square
Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per person (but mind that in this count are
considered also deserts and ice-caps, otherwise the area per person goes
down further: about 1.3 hectares). 

Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United
States in which every one has at his disposal still an area of 3.44 hectares
of national territory, and Australia, where every one can enjoy 50 hectares
(and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are also case of
atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has 0.31 parts of
hectare, and of Bangladesh, where a human being has only 0.10 parts of
hectare, the which gives light of greater clearness to many tragical facts
we see in the daily chronicles told by the media. 

2)	Some researchers of the University of British Columbia, in Canada,
have determined, even though with a large approximation, the ecological
footprint that an individual, based on the style of life he leads, leaves on
the territory. And so, through a special calculator available on the
Internet, it is possible to derive that for the middle european individual
needs of food, lodging, transports, consumer goods, services and what other
he uses to live, it is necessary an area between 6 and 7 hectares. Even
though certainly the measure is rough, we cannot not keep it well in mind in
the important decisional processes relating our Region and Nations. Measure
your own ecological footprint going to: 

http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm 

3)	Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that expresses
itself globally have both values and faults. Here is not the place to face
this argument, but we would however remember that a local economy makes the
society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce innovation; an
economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries certainly
enriches but at the same time creates instability and dependence from
outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of insane economic chase we
are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance born
from having given too much space to the global economy taking it away to the
local one. A re-equilibrium of these two components is the wisest choice to
which one could today dedicate himself in the economic field. 

4)	With regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to
remember that today, in times of science and no longer of brute force, this
development is favoured in an enormously greater way by a qualitative growth
of people, then by their intellectual maturity and preparation, that not by
a simple quantitative growth of population. More than favouring this last,
then, we need to cultivate and organize as best we can the existing
population: so doing, people that today may even be a burden for the society
and are abandoned will tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic
prodigies and to be a positive guide for others. Consider, moreover, that
after such a great exterior, material development like that reached by our
society, a natural organizational evolution, a real interior development,
must necessarily be added now, otherwise the former not supported by the
latter would fall down very soon on itself. 

5)	Concede us this one last note. In case the study would confirm what
we are here hypothesizing (that our territories already support too much
humanity) we must engage ourselves even more, or begin very eagerly, to
contribute in making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose
inhabitants would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying,
or sending for the first time, temporaneous invitations to some of them in
order to freely furnish them the knowledge that we have, that could help
their Community to reach a full self-sufficiency. 

At the same time, to avoid that our dutiful respect for an ideal demographic
density could even in the least thwart the positive process of
universalization of cultures and union of peoples that is already in act, we
should promote even more cultural exchanges of excellent quality (mostly
telematic, being immensely more effective than the simple transport of
organic matter activated by conventional tourism) with all the Countries in
the World.

Egregio amico, condivido  pienamente le sue considerazioni sul problema
demografico dei paesi poveri. Il silenzio su questo problema viene
essenzialmente dalla Chiesa cattolica che chiede insistentemente interventi
a favore dei paesi pi=F9 poveri, ma nello stesso tempo fa una feroce campagna
contro ogni misura di limitazione delle nascite. E' molto difficile fare
emergere, quando si discutono questi problemi, queste problematiche. Pur non
potendo che votare a favore, ho considerato la recente legge italiana sulla
cancellazione del debito una legge  largamente inutile perch=E9 essa non
affronta il problema demografico e perch=E9 essa non pu=F2 impedire - n=E9 =E8
facile trovare il modo di farlo - che i paesi poveri si indebitino
nuovamente per l'acquisto di armi. Ci sono, nella legge, delle clausole
relative a questo aspetto, ma esse sono facilmente evadibili.
Grazie per la sua lettera
Cordialmente
Giorgio La Malfa

Oggetto: Non si dimentichi la Questione Demografica nella cancellazione del
debito!


Gentilissimo Onorevole,

nel considerare la questione della cancellazione del debito dei Paesi
sottosviluppati, la preghiamo caldamente di non dimenticare di mettere in
risalto l'aspetto demografico.

Da qualche tempo, e pi=F9 si va avanti pi=F9 monta la marea, si sta affermando
nelle nostre menti la consapevolezza della necessit=E0 di cancellare il debito
che i paesi pi=F9 poveri avrebbero nei confronti dei paesi pi=F9 sviluppati.

A vedere le condizioni di entrambi i fronti, quelli opulenti del
nord/occidente e quelli miseri del sud/oriente, tale sentimento appare
naturalmente pi=F9 che giustificato, non potendo dimenticare, anche, che i
primi hanno comunque operato, nei secoli, un largo sfruttamento delle
risorse umane e naturali dei secondi.

A questo pressoch=E8 comune sentimento, che condividiamo pienamente, vorremmo
ora aggiungere una brevissima considerazione.


Tutti sappiamo, e non dovrebbe trascorrere un solo istante senza tale
consapevolezza, che il nostro pianeta =E8 ormai estremamente sovrappopolato e
la crescita del numero dei suoi abitanti umani rimane tuttora terribilmente
elevata.

Non dimenticando il malefico influsso delle ipertrofiche attivit=E0 economiche
dei paesi pi=F9 sviluppati per quanto riguarda l'incerto destino del nostro
mondo, notiamo anche che paradossalmente proprio i paesi meno sviluppati,
proprio quelli dove non si trova una briciola di pane od una goccia d'acqua
e che, soprattutto per questo, sono affetti da violenze endemiche, sono
anche quelli che, con le popolazioni ancora soggiogate da una cruda legge di
natura che li conduce ad una riproduzione quasi coatta, maggiormente
continuano ad elevare il numero di abitanti sul pianeta.

Finora praticamente nulla si =E8 fatto (per lo pi=F9 per timore di incorrere in
antipatie varie) per cercare di migliorare tale situazione e far s=EC da
limitare nascite che sono destinate od a precoci ed atroci morti per fame,
malattie e guerre, o nella migliore delle ipotesi ad appesantire un pianeta
gi=E0 stracarico.

Ora, con la proposta di abolire il debito, e con il gran risalto in =E0mbito
mondiale che tale nobile gesto avrebbe, una grande opportunit=E0 si presenta
ai paesi pi=F9 sviluppati. Nel cancellare il peso del debito v=E0 anche, nel
contempo, instaurato un dialogo diretto coi paesi pi=F9 poveri, non solo coi
governi (ch=E8 troppo spesso mirano quasi soltanto a rinfoltire gli eserciti)
ma direttamente e diffusamente coi popoli stessi, un dialogo mirante ad
illustrare le atrocit=E0 conseguenti (per gli individui) ad una riproduzione
selvaggia e la tremenda situazione demografica (per l'intero pianeta).

Vanno specificatamente e diffusamente illustrati i benefici
dell'autodisciplina riproduttiva a partire dal fatto che una prole pi=F9
numerosa oggi non significa maggiore ricchezza, come forse poteva accadere
cent'anni fa, ma certamente maggiore povert=E0.


Cosa questa che ci accomuna tutti sul pianeta: far continuare a crescere la
popolazione, oggi, senza far nulla per cercare di stabilizzarla, non
significa affatto dar sviluppo all'umanit=E0 ma anzi deteriorarla, forse
definitivamente.

Non bisogna sciupare quindi l'occasione di unire al nobile gesto della
cancellazione del debito quello altrettanto nobile di avviare una seria
campagna di consapevolezza demografica a livello mondiale. Un'occasione come
questa potrebbe non ripresentarsi in tempo utile.



RingraziandoLa per l'attenzione, Le rinnoviamo il nostro miglior saluto e
sentimento di gratitudine per il Suo costante impegno sociale.

DEBT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE G8'S ISLAND HIDEAWAY 'VIRTUALLY' SURROUNDED
Jubilee 2000 Press Release, 20 July 2000

As the leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) richest nations meet this weekend
(July 21 - 23) on a remote Pacific Island, they will be surrounded by a
'virtual human chain' of protest.  The location for their annual
get-together is Okinawa, surrounded by shark-infested waters.

Ann Pettifor, Director of Jubilee 2000 said, "The debt crisis is an
emergency that can't wait. Every day 19,000 children die because their
governments have to spend money paying debts rather than on basic services
like health care and clean water.  This is a historic moment.  The G8 must
act decisively this weekend and end the debt crisis.  The eyes of the world
are on them to make sure they don't fail once again."

"The world's leaders are lying low- and who can blame them as they've failed
to deliver on the debt cancellation promises they made last year.  But
people the world over can link up to events using the internet - and send
messages to the G8 leaders telling them to 'drop the debt'.  Jubilee 2000
supportes may not be able to get there in person but will be part of a
virtual human chain.  On the internet, Okinawa is only a click away."

A website, coordinated by Jubilee 2000, (www.summitwatch.net) carries
details of hundreds of Summit Watch events worldwide.  Churches, Jubilee
2000 groups and others from Bangladesh to Jersey are holding concerts,
vigils, human chains, club nights and other imaginative Drop the Debt
events.  

The Summit Watch website allows communities around the world to link-up on
the debt issue and will carry up-to-the-minute coverage of the events in
Okinawa, including the latest official information, comment and analysis by
Jubilee 2000, video clips and news about Summit Watch events worldwide.  

In the weeks leading up to the G8 summit, campaigners have sent over 200,000
e-mails to the world leaders calling on them to drop the debt.  Internet
activity will reach a peak on Friday July 21, dubbed 'Net the Debt Day',
when thousands of Jubilee 2000 activists will take part in one last virtual
push, urging the G8 leaders to cancel 100% of the debts of the poorest
countries.

One of the other major topics to be discussed at the G8 summit is the
'digital divide', looking at the potential opportunities and drawbacks of
new technology.  Ann Pettifor said "The thousands of children who die every
day of hunger cannot eat cybercake.  The G8 need to tackle the cause of the
wealth divide - which is debt."

Notes for Editors: 
1	The e-mail petition was launched by high profile celebrities
including Bono and Mohammad Ali.
2	After a year of promises from the G8, not one country has had any
debt cancelled, and only nine of 41 have had limited relief.  In the
countries where the majority of people live in extreme poverty, up to 60% of
GNP is used to service external debts.

Bene: detto questo, aggiungiamoci anche quest'altro:


Cancellazione del debito: una duplice opportunit=E0


Da qualche tempo, e pi=F9 si va avanti pi=F9 monta la marea, si sta affermando nelle nostre menti la consapevolezza della necessit=E0 di cancellare il debito che i paesi pi=F9 poveri avrebbero nei confronti dei paesi pi=F9 sviluppati.

A vedere le condizioni di entrambi i fronti, quelli opulenti del nord/occidente e quelli miseri del sud/oriente, tale sentimento appare naturalmente pi=F9 che giustificato, non potendo dimenticare, anche, che i primi hanno comunque operato, nei secoli, un largo sfruttamento delle risorse umane e naturali dei secondi. 

A questo pressoch=E8 comune sentimento, che condividiamo pienamente, vorremmo ora aggiungere una brevissima considerazione.


Tutti sappiamo, e non dovrebbe trascorrere un solo istante senza tale consapevolezza, che il nostro pianeta =E8 ormai estremamente sovrappopolato e la crescita del numero dei suoi abitanti umani rimane tuttora terribilmente elevata.

Non dimenticando il malefico influsso delle ipertrofiche attivit=E0 economiche dei paesi pi=F9 sviluppati per quanto riguarda l'incerto destino del nostro mondo, notiamo anche che paradossalmente proprio i paesi meno sviluppati, proprio quelli dove non si trova una briciola di pane od una goccia d'acqua e che, soprattutto per questo, sono affetti da violenze endemiche, sono anche quelli che, con le popolazioni ancora soggiogate da una cruda legge di natura che li conduce ad una riproduzione quasi coatta, maggiormente continuano ad elevare il numero di abitanti sul pianeta.

Finora praticamente nulla si =E8 fatto (per lo pi=F9 per timore di incorrere in antipatie varie) per cercare di migliorare tale situazione e far s=EC da limitare nascite che sono destinate od a precoci ed atroci morti per fame, malattie e guerre, o nella migliore delle ipotesi ad appesantire un pianeta gi=E0 stracarico.

Ora, con la proposta di abolire il debito, e con il gran risalto in =E0mbito mondiale che tale nobile gesto avrebbe, una grande opportunit=E0 si presenta ai paesi pi=F9 sviluppati. Nel cancellare il peso del debito v=E0 anche, nel contempo, instaurato un dialogo diretto coi paesi pi=F9 poveri, non solo coi governi (ch=E8 troppo spesso mirano quasi soltanto a rinfoltire gli eserciti) ma direttamente e diffusamente coi popoli stessi, un dialogo mirante ad illustrare le atrocit=E0 conseguenti (per gli individui) ad una riproduzione selvaggia e la tremenda situazione demografica (per l'intero pianeta).

Vanno specificatamente e diffusamente illustrati i benefici dell'autodisciplina riproduttiva a partire dal fatto che una prole pi=F9 numerosa oggi non significa maggiore ricchezza, come forse poteva accadere cent'anni fa, ma certamente maggiore povert=E0.


Cosa questa che ci accomuna tutti sul pianeta: far continuare a crescere la popolazione, oggi, senza far nulla per cercare di stabilizzarla, non significa affatto dar sviluppo all'umanit=E0 ma anzi deteriorarla, forse definitivamente.

Non bisogna sciupare quindi l'occasione di unire al nobile gesto della cancellazione del debito quello altrettanto nobile di avviare una seria campagna di consapevolezza demografica a livello mondiale. Un'occasione come questa potrebbe non ripresentarsi in tempo utile.

Dear miss Castiglione,

As yet we do not have an e-mail newsletter, but we are considering it.
We are currently redesigning and rebuilding our website. Be sure to take a
look there now and then. You might find a lot of interesting information
there (in Dutch though, English pages are being considered).
Anyway, we will note your e-mail address.

Thanks for your interest,

kind regards,

>
>
> Kind Madame, kind Sir,
>
> We send you our warmest greetings!
>
>
> As you certainly know, in the last few months the world's population has
reached and exceeded the amount of six billion units, that of India having
exceeded one billion. These facts, although they represent a serious
demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and extreme care, have
not been treated with the necessary attention by the general public. Even
the people and groups most socially committed are almost all indifferent to
that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most serious social
illnesses of our era.
>
> With the purpose of encouraging debate and awareness of a theme that
urgently calls to be examined attentively, the issue has been condensed
under the form of a Resolution of Interest and other material published on
an Internet site activated specifically for this purpose with the related
International Forum of reflection and action. (Address below).
>
> Imagining that you, like us, are also feeling these same impulses of
healthy personal involvement, we permit ourselves to contact you at this
point in the hopes that you will want to treat this theme within your Group
and in the administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far from being an
issue that relates only to places far from our Nations, this demographic
problem has, in fact, for some time and in the general unawareness, fully
expressed itself also within those Nations, even made worse by heavily
industrialized ways of life.
>
> And in effect, observing the average of the European Union, we remember
that (according to data of 1997) the population density of the whole
territory is of 127 individuals per square kilometer, that means that every
European, ideally dividing the territory of our Union, has at his disposal
an area of only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1) from which to get his life
needs (note 2) and on which to enjoy his individuality and to express his
creative power.
>
> It is rather complex to determine through a scientific method a total
optimal inhabiting density or the highest reasonable for a society, and to
establish how many individuals a territory can support without degrading
itself; however, with the simple comprehensive view we get by living this
situation personally, it is easy to understand that we have already for some
time exceeded a certain threshold of psychophysic wellbeing and healthiness,
and also of sound economic indipendence, since the European's life, their
territory no longer being enough to satisfy the exigencies of a widely
excessive population, by now depends much more from other zones of the Earth
than from Europe itself.
>
> For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the
current phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from
external overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is right
that the international demographic issue should be faced at, and should
receive contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed, made clear
and decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of overnational and
world political forces, being the problem of a planetary burden, but also in
a local ambient, at a national, regional and even provincial level,
observing both right and duty, as the demographic issue manifests itself
also locally and can find also locally effective solutions.
>
> In particular and to begin, it would be more than opportune to start a
diligent multidisciplinary study on the demographic situation, in every
Region and Nation, on the effects, not at all positive, that the local
overpopulation, not only urban but also rural, produces on the individuals
themselves, on the society and the environment. In this way it could be
finally possible to attribute a more precise responsibility to many of the
problems, still with a vague paternity, that worry us today, and to present
them the solutions they are waiting for. In the same time it would be
extremely auspicable to make clear in what measure we are real children of
our land and in what other we are instead dependent on far zones of the
world, in order to try to re-establish, with time, a sound equilibrium
between these two economic modalities (note 3).
>
> >From this study immediately it would emerge that our present demographic
density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals and that a
further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous motives:
restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would
ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In this
case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an optimal
number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual, the
society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the whole
European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our errands of
present management and plans of future development (note 4).
>
> Also aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would
involve, we believe that the local and planetary situations demand an
immediate and intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that
this engagement of self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to
our Nations, but would also furnish an important point of reference both to
the less developed Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of
population, and to the other more developed, generally affected, like we
are, by hyperurbanization, both being still immersed in the torpor,
distracted and undecided on which direction to take.
>
> For all this, we hope that the demographic issue will rise powerfully to
the attention of our consciences and soon become theme of wide local debate,
and similarly we hope the study here augured will soon become concrete
reality (note 5).
>
>
> Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking you deeply for your courteous attention,
and auguring ourselves that this initiative of ours, though modest, has met
with you some degree of consensus, we extend to you our best wishes.
>
>
> Danilo D'Antonio

>
>
> NOTES
>
> 1) For a brief comparison, and starting with our Country: an Italian
(national average) has at his disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area
much smaller than everyone would wish to, and be opportune to, have at his
disposal. In this heavy, sad situation Italy finds inside the European Union
crowded companions in Germany (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42 hectares
per person), in England (243 inhabitants per square Km - 0.41 hectares per
person), in Belgium (310 inhabitants per square Km - 0.32 hectares per
person), and in Holland (457 inhabitants per square Km - 0.21 hectares per
person). The European average is: 127 inhabitants per square Km, equal to
0.78 hectares per person; the world average is: 44 inhabitants per square
Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per person (but mind that in this count are
considered also deserts and ice-caps, otherwise the area per person goes
down further: about 1.3 hectares).

> Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United
States in which every one has at his disposal still an area of 3.44 hectares
of national territory, and Australia, where every one can enjoy 50 hectares
(and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are also case of
atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has 0.31 parts of
hectare, and of Bangladesh, where a human being has only 0.10 parts of
hectare, the which gives light of greater clearness to many tragical facts
we see in the daily chronicles told by the media.

determined, even though with a large approximation, the ecological footprint
that an individual, based on the style of life he leads, leaves on the
territory. And so, through a special calculator available on the Internet,
it is possible to derive that for the middle european individual needs of
food, lodging, transports, consumer goods, services and what other he uses
to live, it is necessary an area between 6 and 7 hectares. Even though
certainly the measure is rough, we cannot not keep it well in mind in the
important decisional processes relating our Region and Nations. Measure your
own ecological footprint going to:

> 3) Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that expresses
itself globally have both values and faults. Here is not the place to face
this argument, but we would however remember that a local economy makes the
society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce innovation; an
economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries certainly
enriches but at the same time creates instability and dependence from
outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of insane economic chase we
are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance born
from having given too much space to the global economy taking it away to the
local one. A re-equilibrium of these two components is the wisest choice to
which one could today dedicate himself in the economic field.
>
> 4) With regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to remember
that today, in times of science and no longer of brute force, this
development is favoured in an enormously greater way by a qualitative growth
of people, then by their intellectual maturity and preparation, that not by
a simple quantitative growth of population. More than favouring this last,
then, we need to cultivate and organize as best we can the existing
population: so doing, people that today may even be a burden for the society
and are abandoned will tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic
prodigies and to be a positive guide for others. Consider, moreover, that
after such a great exterior, material development like that reached by our
society, a natural organizational evolution, a real interior development,
must necessarily be added now, otherwise the former not supported by the
latter would fall down very soon on itself.
>
> 5) Concede us this one last note. In case the study would confirm what we
are here hypothesizing (that our territories already support too much
humanity) we must engage ourselves even more, or begin very eagerly, to
contribute in making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose
inhabitants would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying,
or sending for the first time, temporaneous invitations to some of them in
order to freely furnish them the knowledge that we have, that could help
their Community to reach a full self-sufficiency.
>
> At the same time, to avoid that our dutiful respect for an ideal
demographic density could even in the least thwart the positive process of
universalization of cultures and union of peoples that is already in act, we
should promote even more cultural exchanges of excellent quality (mostly
telematic, being immensely more effective than the simple transport of
organic matter activated by conventional tourism) with all the Countries in
the World.

Among my project is associate editor of New Rennaissance - a journal that
comes out from Germany. Do you mind if I send your piece to them for
possible publication.

In addition, I am co-editor of the Journal of Futures Studies. I would be
pleased to get a piece from you on the subject of demographics, debt,
futures etc. Would you have anything like that that you are looking for a
publication site for?

Dear Danilo

Thank you for your e-mail. 
We are looking at a multitude of issues. Debt can only be seen in connection
to factors such as environment, Aids, good governance and as you mentioned
population growth. I see you have been extremely careful in making your
point, being aware that it is us in the North who are momentarily destroying
the planet by neglect while the south is having a negative effect by trying
to survive - obviously a bit oversimplyfied.
May I ask you to pass on the enclosed e-mail to all your contacts and maybe
enclose a shorter version in your next online mailing. Also, we want people
to join us on the 21 July on our website to see the outcome of the online
campaign and hear what is really happening at the Okinawa Summit. Maybe you
are able to create a high profile link to us up to next weekend at least -
banners available from dropthedebt/banner.html
Thank you again for your thoughts.

	Hi, Bono here.

	Hows things? I believe the leaders of the richest nations want to
drop the debt. But they seem stuck. They need a big virtual e-push NOW.
Please do this action and forward to your friends.

	4 love and peace, Bono.

	
**************************************************************************	In less than a minute, YOU can help save the lives of the 19000
CHILDREN WHO DIE EACH DAY. These children die because money that should go
on clean water and medicines in the poorest countries is STILL being used to
pay off foreign debt to rich countries.

	Just send one email to the address below and it will go STRAIGHT TO
BILL CLINTON, TONY BLAIR and the other leaders of the 7 richest countries.
If enough people do this, the leaders will cancel the debts when they meet
in Japan on 21st July. 

	1. Email G7lx(at)yedebt.org now.  Put "Drop the Debt Now" in
the subject line. 	2. Forward this message  to at least six people who care about this.
(Or even better, copy and paste into a new email to avoid lots of >>s)

	Visit http://www.dropthedebt.org to see the result of your action
and to find out why Bono, Muhammad Ali and the Pope back the Jubilee 2000
campaign. You will receive an acknowledgement but your email address will
not be stored or passed on.

>
>As you certainly know, in the last few months the world's population has
reached and exceeded the amount of six billion units, that of India having
exceeded one billion. These facts, although they represent a serious
demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and extreme care,
have not been treated with the necessary attention by the general public.
Even the people and groups most socially committed are almost all
indifferent to that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most
serious social illnesses of our era. 
>
>With the purpose of encouraging debate and awareness of a theme that
urgently calls to be examined attentively, the issue has been condensed
under the form of a Resolution of Interest and other material published on
an Internet site activated specifically for this purpose with the related
International Forum of reflection and action. (Address below).
>
>Imagining that you, like us, are also feeling these same impulses of
healthy personal involvement, we permit ourselves to contact you at this
point in the hopes that you will want to treat this theme within your Group
and in the administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far from being an
issue that relates only to places far from our Nations, this demographic
problem has, in fact, for some time and in the general unawareness, fully
expressed itself also within those Nations, even made worse by heavily
industrialized ways of life. 
>
>And in effect, observing the average of the European Union, we remember
that (according to data of 1997) the population density of the whole
territory is of 127 individuals per square kilometer, that means that every
European, ideally dividing the territory of our Union, has at his disposal
an area of only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1) from which to get his life
needs (note 2) and on which to enjoy his individuality and to express his
creative power. 
>
>It is rather complex to determine through a scientific method a total
optimal inhabiting density or the highest reasonable for a society, and to
establish how many individuals a territory can support without degrading
itself; however, with the simple comprehensive view we get by living this
situation personally, it is easy to understand that we have already for
some time exceeded a certain threshold of psychophysic wellbeing and
healthiness, and also of sound economic indipendence, since the European's
life, their territory no longer being enough to satisfy the exigencies of a
widely excessive population, by now depends much more from other zones of
the Earth than from Europe itself. 
>
>For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the
current phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from
external overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is
right that the international demographic issue should be faced at, and
should receive contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed,
made clear and decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of
overnational and world political forces, being the problem of a planetary
burden, but also in a local ambient, at a national, regional and even
provincial level, observing both right and duty, as the demographic issue
manifests itself also locally and can find also locally effective solutions. 
>
>In particular and to begin, it would be more than opportune to start a
diligent multidisciplinary study on the demographic situation, in every
Region and Nation, on the effects, not at all positive, that the local
overpopulation, not only urban but also rural, produces on the individuals
themselves, on the society and the environment. In this way it could be
finally possible to attribute a more precise responsibility to many of the
problems, still with a vague paternity, that worry us today, and to present
them the solutions they are waiting for. In the same time it would be
extremely auspicable to make clear in what measure we are real children of
our land and in what other we are instead dependent on far zones of the
world, in order to try to re-establish, with time, a sound equilibrium
between these two economic modalities (note 3). 
>
>>From this study immediately it would emerge that our present demographic
density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals and that a
further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous motives:
restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would
ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In
this case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an
optimal number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual,
the society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the
whole European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our
errands of present management and plans of future development (note 4). 
>
>Also aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would
involve, we believe that the local and planetary situations demand an
immediate and intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that
this engagement of self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to
our Nations, but would also furnish an important point of reference both to
the less developed Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of
population, and to the other more developed, generally affected, like we
are, by hyperurbanization, both being still immersed in the torpor,
distracted and undecided on which direction to take. 
>
>For all this, we hope that the demographic issue will rise powerfully to
the attention of our consciences and soon become theme of wide local
debate, and similarly we hope the study here augured will soon become
concrete reality (note 5). 
>
>
>Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking you deeply for your courteous attention,
and auguring ourselves that this initiative of ours, though modest, has met
with you some degree of consensus, we extend to you our best wishes.

>
>NOTES
>
>1)	For a brief comparison, and starting with our Country: an Italian
(national average) has at his disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area
much smaller than everyone would wish to, and be opportune to, have at his
disposal. In this heavy, sad situation Italy finds inside the European
Union crowded companions in Germany (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42
hectares per person), in England (243 inhabitants per square Km - 0.41
hectares per person), in Belgium (310 inhabitants per square Km - 0.32
hectares per person), and in Holland (457 inhabitants per square Km - 0.21
hectares per person). The European average is: 127 inhabitants per square
Km, equal to 0.78 hectares per person; the world average is: 44 inhabitants
per square Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per person (but mind that in this
count are considered also deserts and ice-caps, otherwise the area per
person goes down further: about 1.3 hectares). 
>
>Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United
States in which every one has at his disposal still an area of 3.44
hectares of national territory, and Australia, where every one can enjoy 50
hectares (and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are
also case of atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has
0.31 parts of hectare, and of Bangladesh, where a human being has only 0.10
parts of hectare, the which gives light of greater clearness to many
tragical facts we see in the daily chronicles told by the media. 
>
>2)	Some researchers of the University of British Columbia, in Canada, have
determined, even though with a large approximation, the ecological
footprint that an individual, based on the style of life he leads, leaves
on the territory. And so, through a special calculator available on the
Internet, it is possible to derive that for the middle european individual
needs of food, lodging, transports, consumer goods, services and what other
he uses to live, it is necessary an area between 6 and 7 hectares. Even
though certainly the measure is rough, we cannot not keep it well in mind
in the important decisional processes relating our Region and Nations.
Measure your own ecological footprint going to: 
>
>http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm 
>
>3)	Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that expresses
itself globally have both values and faults. Here is not the place to face
this argument, but we would however remember that a local economy makes the
society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce innovation; an
economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries certainly
enriches but at the same time creates instability and dependence from
outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of insane economic chase
we are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance
born from having given too much space to the global economy taking it away
to the local one. A re-equilibrium of these two components is the wisest
choice to which one could today dedicate himself in the economic field. 
>
>4)	With regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to remember
that today, in times of science and no longer of brute force, this
development is favoured in an enormously greater way by a qualitative
growth of people, then by their intellectual maturity and preparation, that
not by a simple quantitative growth of population. More than favouring this
last, then, we need to cultivate and organize as best we can the existing
population: so doing, people that today may even be a burden for the
society and are abandoned will tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic
prodigies and to be a positive guide for others. Consider, moreover, that
after such a great exterior, material development like that reached by our
society, a natural organizational evolution, a real interior development,
must necessarily be added now, otherwise the former not supported by the
latter would fall down very soon on itself. 
>
>5)	Concede us this one last note. In case the study would confirm what we
are here hypothesizing (that our territories already support too much
humanity) we must engage ourselves even more, or begin very eagerly, to
contribute in making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose
inhabitants would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying,
or sending for the first time, temporaneous invitations to some of them in
order to freely furnish them the knowledge that we have, that could help
their Community to reach a full self-sufficiency. 
>
>At the same time, to avoid that our dutiful respect for an ideal
demographic density could even in the least thwart the positive process of
universalization of cultures and union of peoples that is already in act,
we should promote even more cultural exchanges of excellent quality (mostly
telematic, being immensely more effective than the simple transport of
organic matter activated by conventional tourism) with all the Countries in
the World.

---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---




Gentile Signore,

voglia gradire il nostro pi=F9 cordiale saluto!

Come certo sapr=E0, negli ultimi mesi la popolazione mondiale ha raggiunto e
superato i sei miliardi di unit=E0, quella dell'India il miliardo. Tali fatti,
pur rappresentativi di una grave questione demografica che andrebbe
affrontata con immediata ed estrema cura, non hanno invece goduto della
necessaria attenzione pressoch=E8 da parte di alcuno. Anche la maggior parte
delle persone e dei gruppi pi=F9 impegnati socialmente =E8 rimasta quasi del
tutto indifferente davanti a ci=F2 che concorre fortemente al sorgere dei mali
pi=F9 profondi della nostra epoca.

Allo scopo di favorire il dibattito e la consapevolezza di un tema che urge
di essere attentamente esaminato, =E8 stata dunque riassunta la questione
sotto forma della Risoluzione d'Interessamento che vede qui allegata, ed
attivato un sito Internet con relativo Forum Internazionale di riflessione
ed azione.

Immaginando che anche Lei, come noi, stia sentendo questi stessi nostri
impulsi di sano personale coinvolgimento, ci permettiamo ora di contattarLa
nella speranza voglia trattare diffusamente tale tema all'interno del Suo
Gruppo e nelle Assemblee amministrative e politiche locali. Lungi
dall'essere, infatti, una questione riguardante soltanto luoghi lontani
dalle nostre Regioni, il problema demografico si esprime pienamente, ormai
da tempo e nella generale inconsapevolezza, anche in esse, per giunta
aggravato da stili di vita pesantemente industrializzati.

Ed infatti, osservando la media nazionale Italiana, ricordiamo che (secondo
dati del 1998) la densit=E0 abitativa dell'intero territorio =E8 di ben 191
unit=E0 per kmq, la qual cosa equivale a dire che ogni Italiano, ripartendo
idealmente il territorio della nostra nazione, dispone di una area di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro (nota 1) dalla quale trarre il fabbisogno alla sua vita
(nota 2) e sulla quale godere della sua individualit=E0 ed esprimere il suo
potere creativo.

Anche se =E8 cosa piuttosto complessa determinare con metodo scientifico una
densit=E0 abitativa complessiva ottimale o massima auspicabile per una
societ=E0, e stabilire quanti individui un territorio possa sopportare senza
degradarsi, col semplice sguardo d'insieme che ci viene dal vivere in prima
persona questa situazione =E8 per=F2 facile capire come si sia gi=E0 da tempo
superata una certa soglia minima di benessere e salubrit=E0 psicofisiche,
nonch=E8 di sana indipendenza economica, giacch=E8 la vita degli Italiani, non
bastando pi=F9 il loro territorio a soddisfare le esigenze di una popolazione
in largo eccesso, dipende ormai ben pi=F9 da altre zone della Terra che
dall'Italia stessa.

Per questi motivi di sovrappopolazione interna, senza dimenticare gli
attuali fenomeni di immigrazione selvaggia su suolo Italiano, derivanti da
sovrappopolazione esterna e certamente destinati a crescere, pensiamo che
sia opportuno che la questione demografica internazionale vada affrontata a,
e debba ricevere l'apporto da, vari livelli. Essa deve essere discussa,
chiarita e decisa, s=EC, in =E0mbito globale, con l'intervento di forze
politiche nazionali e sovranazionali, essendo il problema di portata
planetaria, ma anche in =E0mbito locale, ad ogni buon diritto e dovere, poich=E8
=E8 anche localmente che essa si manifesta e anche localmente pu=F2 trovare
efficaci soluzioni.

In particolare e per cominciare, sarebbe pi=F9 che opportuno avviare un
solerte studio multidisciplinare sulla situazione demografica locale, in
ogni Provincia e Regione, sugli effetti, per nulla positivi, che la
sovrappopolazione locale, non solo cittadina ma anche rurale, produce sugli
individui stessi, la societ=E0 e l'ambiente. In tal modo sarebbe possibile
attribuire finalmente una responsabilit=E0 ben precisa a tanti dei problemi
ancora con paternit=E0 vaga che oggi ci assillano, e presentar loro le
soluzioni che stavano aspettando. Allo stesso tempo sarebbe oltremodo
auspicabile chiarire in che misura siamo reali figli della nostra terra ed
in quale altra siamo invece dipendenti da lontane zone del mondo, per
cercare di ristabilire, nel tempo, un sano equilibrio tra queste due
modalit=E0 economiche (nota 3).

Da questo studio emergerebbe immediatamente che l'attuale nostra densit=E0
demografica ha gi=E0 raggiunto e superato evidenti segnali di pericolo e che
una ulteriore crescita della popolazione locale (non importa se per motivi
endogeni: ripresa della natalit=E0 locale, od esogeni: per immigrazione)
aggraverebbe ulteriormente e terribilmente la nostra gi=E0 precaria
situazione. In tal caso, pur con ritardo, questo stesso studio dovrebbe
allora determinare un numero ottimale, per la nostra epoca e dal punto di
vista dell'individuo, della societ=E0 e dell'ambiente, di abitanti per
Provincia e per l'intera Regione, cui far riferimento per ogni nostra
incombenza di gestione presente e progetto di sviluppo futuro (nota 4).

Pur consapevoli delle numerose implicazioni che una tale iniziativa
comporterebbe, crediamo che la situazione locale e planetaria richieda un
immediato ed intenso impegno in questa direzione. Crediamo anche che questo
nostro impegno di autodisciplina non solo assicurerebbe un sereno futuro
alle nostre Regioni, ma fornirebbe anche un importante punto di riferimento
sia ai Paesi meno sviluppati, generalmente affetti da crescita esponenziale
della popolazione, che a quelli pi=F9 sviluppati, generalmente affetti da
iperurbanizzazione, entrambi ancora immersi nel torpore, frastornati ed
indecisi sulla direzione da prendere.

Per tutto ci=F2, speriamo che la questione demografica emerga potentemente
all'attenzione delle coscienze e diventi tema di diffuso dibattito locale, e
cos=EC pure speriamo che lo studio qui auspicato diventi presto concreta
realt=E0 (nota 5).

Gentile Signore, ringraziandoLa profondamente per la Sua cortese attenzione,
ed augurandoci che questa nostra, pur modesta, iniziativa abbia incontrato
presso di Lei un qualche grado di consenso, Le rinnoviamo il nostro miglior
saluto.

NOTE


1) Per un breve confronto: un italiano (media nazionale) dispone di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro, un'area ben inferiore a quella che ognuno possa
desiderare di, e sia opportuno, disporre. In questa pesante, triste
situazione l'Italia trova all'interno dell'Unione Europea ricolmi compagni
nella Germania (235 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.42 ettari per persona),
nell'Inghilterra (243 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.41 ettari per persona), nel
Belgio (310 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.32 ettari per persona) e nell'Olanda (457
abitanti per Kmq. - 0.21 ettari per persona). La media europea =E8: 127
abitanti per Kmq. pari a 0.78 ettari per persona; quella mondiale =E8: 44
abitanti per Kmq. pari a 2.27 ettari per persona (ma si badi che in questo
conteggio vengono considerati anche deserti e calotte polari, altrimenti
l'area pro-capite si abbassa ulteriormente: circa 1.3 ettari).

All'interno della situazione planetaria, si verificano casi come quelli
degli Stati Uniti in cui ognuno dispone ancora di un'area di 3,44 ettari di
territorio nazionale, e dell'Australia, dove ognuno pu=F2 godere di ben 50
ettari (ed auguriamoci che sappiano conservarseli!); ed anche casi di
atavica incuria come quelli dell'India, dove ognuno dispone di 0,31 parti di
ettaro, e del Bangladesh, dove un essere umano dispone di soli 0,10 parti di
ettaro, la qual cosa d=E0 una luce di maggior chiarezza a molti tragici fatti
che vediamo riportati nelle quotidiane cronache narrate dai media.

2) Alcuni ricercatori della University of British Columbia, in Canada, hanno
determinato, pur con larga approssimazione, la ecological footprint,
l'impronta ecologica che un individuo, in base allo stile di vita che
conduce, lascia sul territorio. E cos=EC, tramite un loro apposito calcolatore
reso disponibile in Internet, =E8 possibile derivare che per le necessit=E0
medie individuali europee di cibo, alloggio, trasporti, beni di consumo,
servizi e quant'altro si usi per vivere, =E8 necessaria un'area compresa tra i
6 ed i 7 ettari. Pur certo essendo rozza la misura, non possiamo non tenerla
ben presente negli importanti processi decisionali relativi alla nostre
Provincie e Regioni. Si misuri la propria personale impronta ecologica
recandosi at:

3) Sia una economia che si attui localmente che una che si attui globalmente
hanno entrambe pregi e difetti. Non =E8 il caso di affrontare qui l'argomento,
ma vorremmo comunque ricordare che una economia locale rende la societ=E0 che
la pratica pi=F9 solida a fronte di una scarsa innovazione; una economia che
si basi su scambi con paesi lontani certo arricchisce ma allo stesso tempo
crea instabilit=E0 e dipendenza dall'esterno. Il clima di continua emergenza e
di folle rincorsa economica che oggi viviamo deriva in gran parte proprio
dallo squilibrio che si =E8 creato per aver dato troppo spazio all'economia
globale togliendolo a quella locale. Uno riequilibrio di queste due
componenti =E8 la scelta pi=F9 assennata cui ci si possa oggi dedicare in campo
economico.

4) In riguardo al nostro sviluppo futuro, ci si permette di ricordare che
oggi, in tempi di scienza e non pi=F9 di forza bruta, esso =E8 favorito in
maniera enormemente maggiore da una crescita qualitativa delle persone,
quindi da una loro maturazione e preparazione intellettuale, che non da una
semplice crescita quantitativa della popolazione. Pi=F9 che favorire
quest'ultima, quindi, occorre coltivare ed organizzare meglio che si possa
la popolazione esistente: cos=EC facendo, persone che oggi sono persino di
peso alla societ=E0 ed emarginate diverranno domani in grado di compiere
autentici prodigi e di far da positiva guida ad altri. Si consideri inoltre
che ad un cos=EC grande sviluppo esteriore, materiale, come quello raggiunto
dalla nostra societ=E0, deve necessariamente aggiungersi ora una naturale
evoluzione organizzativa, un vero sviluppo interiore, altrimenti il primo
non sorretto dal secondo si accascer=E0 ben presto su s=E8 stesso.

5) Ci sia concessa un'ultima nota. Qualora lo studio confermasse ci=F2 che qui
si ipotizza (che il nostro territorio sopporta gi=E0 troppa umanit=E0) dovremo
impegnarci ancor pi=F9, od iniziare di buzzo buono, a contribuire a rendere
migliori le condizioni di vita in quei Paesi i cui abitanti avrebbero
desiderato trasferirsi presso di noi. Magari, proprio intensificando, od
inviando per la prima volta, inviti temporanei ad alcuni di loro per

Allo stesso tempo, per evitare che il nostro doveroso rispetto per una

Gentile dott. D'Antonio,

Iniziare questo dibattito =E8 senz'altro stimolante, per quanto la complessit=E0
delle problematiche in atto =E8 difficilmente affrontabile in poche righe.
Per esempio parlando di sovrappopolazione e demografia non possiamo
dimenticare come il nostro sistema socio-economico di ammortizzazione
sociale sia basato sulla presenza di una larga base di giovani lavoratori
per il sostentamento della popolazione non attiva. L'allungamento della vita
media ha allargato la "testa" della piramide, che rischia ora di crollare in
mancanza di una base ancora pi=F9 larga. Difatti le pi=F9 recenti notizie
riguardano gli aumenti nelle quote immigrazione, piuttosto che le loro
diminuzioni: economicamente parlando, c'=E8 realmente un gran bisogno di
giovani o
immigrati da far entrare nelle file della popolazione attiva.
Come per=F2 giustamente fate notare nella vostra relazione, tutto questo =E8
ecologicamente e termodinamicamente sbagliato. Esaminiamo la situazione dal
"solo" punto di vista energetico. Il flusso di energia proveniente dal Sole
=E8 l'unico di cui la Terra dispone ed alimenta ogni forma energetica
sfruttata dall'uomo sulla faccia della Terra: fa crescere i raccolti;
tramite riscaldamenti differenziali genera i venti ed il ciclo
dell'acqua (ed =E8 quell'energia che ricaviamo come eolica e idorelettrica);
nelle ere passate ha fatto crescere moli immense di piante ed alghe che ora
sono il nostro carbone ed il nostro petrolio (che noi bruciamo ad un tasso
molto superiore a quello di ri-immagazzinamento); e cos=EC via. In aggiunta a
tutto ci=F2, l'energia in arrivo sulla Terra deve alimentare a sufficienza
anche il "funzionamento" del sistema naturale, sia nella componente
biologica che in quella abiotica, che non hanno solo un valore "estetico" e
"morale" (che qui volutamente tralascio), ma anche pratico ed
insostituibile: basti pensare alla foresta amazzonica, la cui
evapo-traspirazione alimenta il ciclo mondiale
dell'acqua, alle correnti oceaniche, che ridistribuiscono su scala mondiale
l'energia solare accumulata nei mari tropicali, alle foreste himalayane che
regolano (o  meglio regolavano) le piene monsoniche dei grandi fiumi nella
zona indiana; al di l=E0 di qualunque discorso sul valore della biodiversit=E0,
sulla bellezza della natura, ecc, ci sono alcuni "servizi" naturali, fisici,
come il ciclo dell'acqua, la regolazione del carbonio atmosferico, la
regolazione dell'erosione e creazione dei suoli, che dipendono dal buon
funzionamento degli ecosistemi per andare avanti, e che non sono in alcun
modo
riproducibili dall'uomo, nemmeno con le pi=F9 avanzate tecnologie. E' in
questo contesto che va inquadrata l'impronta ecologica, che ci dice qualcosa
di pi=F9 che il semplice "spazio" effettivamente disponibile. Anche quando si
parla di "fonti energetiche
rinnovabili", ricordiamoci che non possiamo tappezzare il Sahara con celle
fotovoltaiche o sfruttare tutta l'energia delle correnti oceaniche: si
creerebbero vere e proprie alterazioni del clima mondiale.
Insomma, comunque la mettiamo, =E8 dimostrabile numeri alla mano che non solo
siamo troppi, ma consumiamo enormemente troppo. Parallelamente allo sviluppo
delle fonti energetiche alternative, =E8 indispensabile attuare politiche di
risparmio energetico molto severe. Ec =E8 qui che la scienza deve intersecarsi
con l'economia. Infatti quanto fin qui esposto =E8 ci=F2 che sarebbe logico
ecologicamente, scientificamente. Purtroppo, come facevo notare all'inizio,
l'economia segue leggi diverse, e perci=F2 ci porta nella direzione sbagliata.
Ecologicamente siamo troppi; per diminuire dovremmo invertire la piramide
demografica; ma questo =E8 economicamente e socialmente
impossibile, per lo meno con gli attuali meccanismi socio-economici.
A mio avviso, parallelamente alla ricerca scientifica ecologica (intesa nel
senso pi=F9 vasto, che comprende anche la componente fisica del sistema
Terra), deve esser attuata una seria e realistica ricerca socio economica
che studi come rendere possibile la "devolution", la riduzione di
popolazione, tenendo anche presente che la nostra psiche ed il nostro senso
sociale non si sono evoluti per vivere in una societ=E0 di anziani, in
declino, e che quindi ci saranno
fortissime, forse insormontabili resistenze in questo senso: la spinta alla
riproduzione ed alla crescita =E8 impressa nei nostri geni prima ancora che
nelle nostre strutture sociali ed economiche, che da essi sono in fondo
derivate. Difatti, il meccanismo "naturale" di repressione della crescita,
da che mondo =E8 mondo ed in tutte le specie animali e addirittura vegetali,
non =E8 la soppressione della riproduzione, ma la guerra, la violenza,
qualcosa che fa aumentare la mortalit=E0.
Riuscir=E0 l'uomo ad aggirare questa "legge di natura", come ha aggirato molte
altre (la resistenza al freddo aumentata con i vestiti ed il fuoco, la
capacit=E0 digestiva aumentata con la cottura dei cibi, la capacit=E0 offensiva
con le armi, la capacit=E0 di spostamento con cavalli navi treni auto aerei,
la capacit=E0 di comunicazione con Internet)?
Se s=EC, la specie umana potr=E0 contare su una lunga e prospera sopravvivenza;
se no, non ci resta che attendere, entro qualche secolo o forse meno, la
prossima crisi mondiale; se questa sar=E0 una catastrofe ecologica, la specie
umana potrebbe anche scomparire; altrimenti si tratter=E0 solo di una delle
solite "crisi di mortalit=E0" che da sempre l'uomo e le altre specie
conoscono.
Chiudo qui, perch=E9 volendo potrei continuare a scrivere per un bel po'.
Aggiungo che per motivi di lavoro ho recentemente lasciato la carica di
Segretaria di Sezione presso L'AISA AQ; tale carica =E8 passata alla dott.ssa
Gioia Sambenedetto (samx(at)yl.com) che affianca il Presidente Enrico
Gattone di cui gi=E0 avete l'indirizzo mail. A settembre partir=F2 per un
dottorato di ricerca in Scozia, sulla conservazione del gallo cedrone.
Cordialmente

Gentile Signore,

voglia gradire il nostro pi=F9 cordiale saluto!

Come certo sapr=E0, negli ultimi mesi la popolazione mondiale ha raggiunto e
superato i sei miliardi di unit=E0, quella dell'India il miliardo. Tali fatti,
pur rappresentativi di una grave questione demografica che andrebbe
affrontata con immediata ed estrema cura, non hanno invece goduto della
necessaria attenzione pressoch=E8 da parte di alcuno. Anche la maggior parte
delle persone e dei gruppi pi=F9 impegnati socialmente =E8 rimasta quasi del
tutto indifferente davanti a ci=F2 che concorre fortemente al sorgere dei mali
pi=F9 profondi della nostra epoca.

Allo scopo di favorire il dibattito e la consapevolezza di un tema che urge
di essere attentamente esaminato, =E8 stata dunque riassunta la questione
sotto forma della Risoluzione d'Interessamento che vede qui allegata, ed
attivato un sito Internet con relativo Forum Internazionale di riflessione
ed azione.

Immaginando che anche Lei, come noi, stia sentendo questi stessi nostri
impulsi di sano personale coinvolgimento, ci permettiamo ora di contattarLa
nella speranza voglia trattare diffusamente tale tema all'interno del Suo
Gruppo e nelle Assemblee amministrative e politiche locali. Lungi
dall'essere, infatti, una questione riguardante soltanto luoghi lontani
dalle nostre Regioni, il problema demografico si esprime pienamente, ormai
da tempo e nella generale inconsapevolezza, anche in esse, per giunta
aggravato da stili di vita pesantemente industrializzati.

Ed infatti, osservando la media nazionale Italiana, ricordiamo che (secondo
dati del 1998) la densit=E0 abitativa dell'intero territorio =E8 di ben 191
unit=E0 per kmq, la qual cosa equivale a dire che ogni Italiano, ripartendo
idealmente il territorio della nostra nazione, dispone di una area di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro (nota 1) dalla quale trarre il fabbisogno alla sua vita
(nota 2) e sulla quale godere della sua individualit=E0 ed esprimere il suo
potere creativo.

Anche se =E8 cosa piuttosto complessa determinare con metodo scientifico una
densit=E0 abitativa complessiva ottimale o massima auspicabile per una
societ=E0, e stabilire quanti individui un territorio possa sopportare senza
degradarsi, col semplice sguardo d'insieme che ci viene dal vivere in prima
persona questa situazione =E8 per=F2 facile capire come si sia gi=E0 da tempo
superata una certa soglia minima di benessere e salubrit=E0 psicofisiche,
nonch=E8 di sana indipendenza economica, giacch=E8 la vita degli Italiani, non
bastando pi=F9 il loro territorio a soddisfare le esigenze di una popolazione
in largo eccesso, dipende ormai ben pi=F9 da altre zone della Terra che
dall'Italia stessa.

Per questi motivi di sovrappopolazione interna, senza dimenticare gli
attuali fenomeni di immigrazione selvaggia su suolo Italiano, derivanti da
sovrappopolazione esterna e certamente destinati a crescere, pensiamo che
sia opportuno che la questione demografica internazionale vada affrontata a,
e debba ricevere l'apporto da, vari livelli. Essa deve essere discussa,
chiarita e decisa, s=EC, in =E0mbito globale, con l'intervento di forze
politiche nazionali e sovranazionali, essendo il problema di portata
planetaria, ma anche in =E0mbito locale, ad ogni buon diritto e dovere, poich=E8
=E8 anche localmente che essa si manifesta e anche localmente pu=F2 trovare
efficaci soluzioni.

In particolare e per cominciare, sarebbe pi=F9 che opportuno avviare un
solerte studio multidisciplinare sulla situazione demografica locale, in
ogni Provincia e Regione, sugli effetti, per nulla positivi, che la
sovrappopolazione locale, non solo cittadina ma anche rurale, produce sugli
individui stessi, la societ=E0 e l'ambiente. In tal modo sarebbe possibile
attribuire finalmente una responsabilit=E0 ben precisa a tanti dei problemi
ancora con paternit=E0 vaga che oggi ci assillano, e presentar loro le
soluzioni che stavano aspettando. Allo stesso tempo sarebbe oltremodo
auspicabile chiarire in che misura siamo reali figli della nostra terra ed
in quale altra siamo invece dipendenti da lontane zone del mondo, per
cercare di ristabilire, nel tempo, un sano equilibrio tra queste due
modalit=E0 economiche (nota 3).

Da questo studio emergerebbe immediatamente che l'attuale nostra densit=E0
demografica ha gi=E0 raggiunto e superato evidenti segnali di pericolo e che
una ulteriore crescita della popolazione locale (non importa se per motivi
endogeni: ripresa della natalit=E0 locale, od esogeni: per immigrazione)
aggraverebbe ulteriormente e terribilmente la nostra gi=E0 precaria
situazione. In tal caso, pur con ritardo, questo stesso studio dovrebbe
allora determinare un numero ottimale, per la nostra epoca e dal punto di
vista dell'individuo, della societ=E0 e dell'ambiente, di abitanti per
Provincia e per l'intera Regione, cui far riferimento per ogni nostra
incombenza di gestione presente e progetto di sviluppo futuro (nota 4).

Pur consapevoli delle numerose implicazioni che una tale iniziativa
comporterebbe, crediamo che la situazione locale e planetaria richieda un
immediato ed intenso impegno in questa direzione. Crediamo anche che questo
nostro impegno di autodisciplina non solo assicurerebbe un sereno futuro
alle nostre Regioni, ma fornirebbe anche un importante punto di riferimento
sia ai Paesi meno sviluppati, generalmente affetti da crescita esponenziale
della popolazione, che a quelli pi=F9 sviluppati, generalmente affetti da
iperurbanizzazione, entrambi ancora immersi nel torpore, frastornati ed
indecisi sulla direzione da prendere.

Per tutto ci=F2, speriamo che la questione demografica emerga potentemente
all'attenzione delle coscienze e diventi tema di diffuso dibattito locale, e
cos=EC pure speriamo che lo studio qui auspicato diventi presto concreta
realt=E0 (nota 5).

Gentile Signore, ringraziandoLa profondamente per la Sua cortese attenzione,
ed augurandoci che questa nostra, pur modesta, iniziativa abbia incontrato
presso di Lei un qualche grado di consenso, Le rinnoviamo il nostro miglior
saluto.

NOTE


1) Per un breve confronto: un italiano (media nazionale) dispone di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro, un'area ben inferiore a quella che ognuno possa
desiderare di, e sia opportuno, disporre. In questa pesante, triste
situazione l'Italia trova all'interno dell'Unione Europea ricolmi compagni
nella Germania (235 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.42 ettari per persona),
nell'Inghilterra (243 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.41 ettari per persona), nel
Belgio (310 abitanti per Kmq. - 0.32 ettari per persona) e nell'Olanda (457
abitanti per Kmq. - 0.21 ettari per persona). La media europea =E8: 127
abitanti per Kmq. pari a 0.78 ettari per persona; quella mondiale =E8: 44
abitanti per Kmq. pari a 2.27 ettari per persona (ma si badi che in questo
conteggio vengono considerati anche deserti e calotte polari, altrimenti
l'area pro-capite si abbassa ulteriormente: circa 1.3 ettari).

All'interno della situazione planetaria, si verificano casi come quelli
degli Stati Uniti in cui ognuno dispone ancora di un'area di 3,44 ettari di
territorio nazionale, e dell'Australia, dove ognuno pu=F2 godere di ben 50
ettari (ed auguriamoci che sappiano conservarseli!); ed anche casi di
atavica incuria come quelli dell'India, dove ognuno dispone di 0,31 parti di
ettaro, e del Bangladesh, dove un essere umano dispone di soli 0,10 parti di
ettaro, la qual cosa d=E0 una luce di maggior chiarezza a molti tragici fatti
che vediamo riportati nelle quotidiane cronache narrate dai media.

2) Alcuni ricercatori della University of British Columbia, in Canada, hanno
determinato, pur con larga approssimazione, la ecological footprint,
l'impronta ecologica che un individuo, in base allo stile di vita che
conduce, lascia sul territorio. E cos=EC, tramite un loro apposito calcolatore
reso disponibile in Internet, =E8 possibile derivare che per le necessit=E0
medie individuali europee di cibo, alloggio, trasporti, beni di consumo,
servizi e quant'altro si usi per vivere, =E8 necessaria un'area compresa tra i
6 ed i 7 ettari. Pur certo essendo rozza la misura, non possiamo non tenerla
ben presente negli importanti processi decisionali relativi alla nostre
Provincie e Regioni. Si misuri la propria personale impronta ecologica
recandosi at:

http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm

3) Sia una economia che si attui localmente che una che si attui globalmente
hanno entrambe pregi e difetti. Non =E8 il caso di affrontare qui l'argomento,
ma vorremmo comunque ricordare che una economia locale rende la societ=E0 che
la pratica pi=F9 solida a fronte di una scarsa innovazione; una economia che
si basi su scambi con paesi lontani certo arricchisce ma allo stesso tempo
crea instabilit=E0 e dipendenza dall'esterno. Il clima di continua emergenza e
di folle rincorsa economica che oggi viviamo deriva in gran parte proprio
dallo squilibrio che si =E8 creato per aver dato troppo spazio all'economia
globale togliendolo a quella locale. Uno riequilibrio di queste due
componenti =E8 la scelta pi=F9 assennata cui ci si possa oggi dedicare in campo
economico.

4) In riguardo al nostro sviluppo futuro, ci si permette di ricordare che
oggi, in tempi di scienza e non pi=F9 di forza bruta, esso =E8 favorito in
maniera enormemente maggiore da una crescita qualitativa delle persone,
quindi da una loro maturazione e preparazione intellettuale, che non da una
semplice crescita quantitativa della popolazione. Pi=F9 che favorire
quest'ultima, quindi, occorre coltivare ed organizzare meglio che si possa
la popolazione esistente: cos=EC facendo, persone che oggi sono persino di
peso alla societ=E0 ed emarginate diverranno domani in grado di compiere
autentici prodigi e di far da positiva guida ad altri. Si consideri inoltre
che ad un cos=EC grande sviluppo esteriore, materiale, come quello raggiunto
dalla nostra societ=E0, deve necessariamente aggiungersi ora una naturale
evoluzione organizzativa, un vero sviluppo interiore, altrimenti il primo
non sorretto dal secondo si accascer=E0 ben presto su s=E8 stesso.

5) Ci sia concessa un'ultima nota. Qualora lo studio confermasse ci=F2 che qui
si ipotizza (che il nostro territorio sopporta gi=E0 troppa umanit=E0) dovremo
impegnarci ancor pi=F9, od iniziare di buzzo buono, a contribuire a rendere
migliori le condizioni di vita in quei Paesi i cui abitanti avrebbero
desiderato trasferirsi presso di noi. Magari, proprio intensificando, od
inviando per la prima volta, inviti temporanei ad alcuni di loro per
fornirli del tutto gratuitamente di conoscenze di cui disponiamo che possano
aiutare la loro Comunit=E0 a raggiungere una piena autosufficienza.

Allo stesso tempo, per evitare che il nostro doveroso rispetto per una
densit=E0 demografica ottimale possa pur minimamente ostacolare il positivo
processo in atto di universalizzazione delle culture ed unione dei popoli,
dovremo promuovere ancor pi=F9 scambi culturali di ottima qualit=E0 (soprattutto
telematici, perch=E8 immensamente pi=F9 efficaci rispetto al semplice trasporto
di materia organica attivato dal turismo convenzionale) con tutti i Paesi
del mondo.

Gentile Marinella Castiglione,
quale responsabile dell'area "Solidarieta'" di Mediacity, mi e' stato
chiesto dal sig. Rossi di rispondervi in merito alla vostra mail.

Dopo un'attenta lettura, vorrei esprimervi alcune mie perplessita'.
Certamente si tratta di  tematiche di grande importanza, ma mi sembra
che il problema sia stato affrontato con un'ottica "egoistica": dobbiamo
essere in meno per vivere bene.
Non dico che sia sbagliato come concetto, in quanto certamente una
quantita' di territorio "vitale" e' necessaria per vivere
dignitosamente, ma il parlare di troppa gente IN ITALIA (sottilmente,
forse involontariamente, anche contro l'immigrazione), facendo paragoni
con paesi ricchi in cui hanno piu' territorio pro capite e con paesi
poveri dove ne hanno meno, tralasciando (anche qui mi sorge il dubbio:
volontariamente?) paragoni ad esempio con l'Olanda (paese piu'
densamente popolato del nostro).....
Non lo so, sono tutti particolari che mi danno l'impressione di un
approccio sbagliato ad un argomento certamente importante.
Spero comunque di sbagliarmi e di avere male interpretato il contenuto
della vostra iniziativa.

Vi ringrazio comunque per il vostro contatto e spero che, nonostante
questa mia idea iniziale, si possa comunque continuare a parlare di
queste tematiche che, ripeto, considero comunque di grande importanza.

Gentili Signori,


vogliate gradire il nostro pi=F9 cordiale saluto!


Come certo saprete, negli ultimi mesi la popolazione mondiale ha raggiunto e
superato i sei miliardi di unit=E0, quella dell'India il miliardo. Tali fatti,
pur rappresentativi di una grave questione demografica che andrebbe
affrontata con immediata ed estrema cura, non hanno invece goduto della
necessaria attenzione pressoch=E8 da parte di alcuno. Anche la maggior parte
delle persone e dei gruppi pi=F9 impegnati socialmente =E8 rimasta quasi del
tutto indifferente davanti a ci=F2 che concorre fortemente al sorgere dei mali
pi=F9 profondi della nostra epoca.

Allo scopo di favorire il dibattito e la consapevolezza di un tema che urge
di essere attentamente esaminato, =E8 stata dunque riassunta la questione
sotto forma di una proposta di risoluzione allegata al sito Internet:

http://spg.hyperlinker.com/

con relativo Forum Internazionale di riflessione ed azione.

Immaginando che anche Voi, come noi, stiate sentendo questi stessi nostri
impulsi di sano personale coinvolgimento, ci permettiamo ora di contattarVi
nella speranza vogliate trattare diffusamente tale tema all'interno del
Vostro Gruppo e nelle Assemblee amministrative e politiche locali.

Lungi dall'essere, infatti, una questione coinvolgente soltanto luoghi
lontani dalle nostre rispettive Regioni, il problema demografico, a meno di
un immediato impegno generalizzato, coinvolger=E0 queste ultime sempre di pi=F9,
direttamente ed indirettamente, gli attuali fenomeni di immigrazione
selvaggia che stiamo osservando in questi tempi essendo soltanto le prime
avvisaglie di un fenomeno destinato a crescere ben oltre la nostra presente
immaginazione, e lo stesso dicasi di fenomeni strettamente collegati alla
crescita demografica come l'inquinamento ed il global warming.

Anche per questo motivo, non solo quindi per contribuire a rimuovere le
grandi sofferenze che accompagnano la crescita selvaggia della popolazione
nei Paesi meno sviluppati, pensiamo che sia opportuno che la questione
demografica internazionale vada affrontata a, e riceva l'apporto da, vari
livelli. Essa deve essere discussa, chiarita e decisa, s=EC, in =E0mbito
globale, con l'intervento di forze politiche nazionali e sovranazionali, ma
anche in =E0mbito locale, con l'intervento delle forze politiche ed enti
governativi provinciali e regionali, non dimenticando che ogni Regione
d'Italia sta gi=E0 vivendo anch'essa, nella generale inconsapevolezza, un suo
proprio grave problema demografico.

Ed infatti, osservando la media nazionale Italiana, ricordiamo che (secondo
dati del 1998) la densit=E0 abitativa della nostra nazione =E8 di ben 191 unit=E0
per kmq, la qual cosa equivale a dire che ogni Italiano, ripartendo
idealmente il territorio della nostra nazione, dispone di una area di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro (troverete i dati regione per regione in una cartina
presente sul sito sopra segnalato) dalla quale trarre il fabbisogno alla sua
vita (nota 1) e sulla quale esprimere il suo potere creativo.

Anche se =E8 cosa piuttosto complessa determinare con metodo scientifico una
densit=E0 abitativa complessiva ottimale o massima auspicabile per una societ=E0
e stabilire quanti individui un territorio possa sopportare senza
degradarsi, col semplice sguardo d'insieme che ci viene dal vivere in prima
persona questa situazione =E8 per=F2 facile capire come si sia gi=E0 da tempo
superata una certa soglia minima di benessere e salubrit=E0 psicofisiche,
nonch=E8 di sana indipendenza economica, giacch=E8 la vita degli Italiani, non
bastando pi=F9 il loro territorio a soddisfare le esigenze di una popolazione
in largo eccesso, dipende ormai ben pi=F9 da altre zone della Terra che
dall'Italia stessa.

Sarebbe pi=F9 che opportuno, quindi, avviare un solerte studio sulla
situazione demografica locale, in ogni provincia e regione, sugli effetti,
per nulla positivi, che la sovrappopolazione locale, non solo cittadina ma
anche rurale, produce sugli individui stessi, la societ=E0 e l'ambiente. In
tal modo sarebbe possibile attribuire finalmente una responsabilit=E0 ben
precisa a tanti dei problemi ancora con paternit=E0 vaga che oggi ci
assillano, e presentar loro le soluzioni che stavano aspettando. Allo stesso
tempo sarebbe oltremodo auspicabile chiarire in che misura siamo reali figli
della nostra terra ed in quale altra siamo invece dipendenti da lontane zone
del mondo, per cercare di ristabilire, nel tempo, un sano equilibrio tra
queste due modalit=E0 economiche (nota 2).

Da questo studio emergerebbe immediatamente che una ulteriore crescita della
popolazione locale (non importa se per motivi endogeni: ripresa della
natalit=E0 locale, od esogeni: per immigrazione) aggraverebbe ulteriormente e
terribilmente la nostra gi=E0 precaria situazione. In tal caso, questo stesso
studio dovrebbe allora determinare un numero ottimale, dal punto di vista
dell'individuo, della societ=E0 e dell'ambiente, di abitanti per Provincia e
per l'intera Regione, cui far riferimento per ogni nostra incombenza di
gestione presente e progetto di sviluppo futuro (nota 3).

Pur consapevoli delle numerose implicazioni che una tale iniziativa
comporterebbe, crediamo che la situazione locale e planetaria richieda un
immediato ed intenso impegno in questa direzione. Crediamo anche che questo
impegno di autodisciplina non solo assicurerebbe un sereno futuro alle
nostre Regioni, ma fornirebbe anche un importante punto di riferimento sia
ai Paesi meno sviluppati, affetti da crescita esponenziale della
popolazione, che a quelli pi=F9 sviluppati, affetti da iperurbanizzazione,
entrambi ancora immersi nel torpore, frastornati ed indecisi sulla direzione
da prendere.

Per tutto ci=F2, speriamo che la questione demografica emerga potentemente
all'attenzione delle coscienze e diventi tema di diffuso dibattito locale, e
cos=EC pure speriamo che lo studio qui auspicato diventi presto concreta
realt=E0 (nota 4).

Gentili Signori, ringraziandoVi profondamente per la Vostra cortese
attenzione, ed augurandoci che questa nostra, pur modesta, iniziativa abbia
incontrato presso di Voi un qualche grado di consenso, Vi rinnoviamo il
nostro miglior saluto.

Per un breve confronto, mentre un italiano (media nazionale) dispone di sole
0,52 parti di ettaro, un'area ben inferiore a quella che ognuno possa
desiderare di, e sia opportuno, disporre, per ogni statunitense vi =E8 un'area
di 3,44 ettari di territorio nazionale e per ogni australiano ben 50 ettari.
Tutt'altra cosa avviene in India, dove ognuno dispone di 0,31 parti di
ettaro, e nel Bangladesh, dove un essere umano dispone di soli 0,10 parti di
ettaro, la qual cosa chiarisce molti tragici fatti che vediamo riportati
nelle quotidiane cronache narrate dai media.



NOTE

1) Alcuni ricercatori della University of British Columbia, in Canada, hanno
determinato, pur con larga approssimazione, la ecological footprint,
l'impronta ecologica che un individuo, in base allo stile di vita che
conduce, lascia sul territorio. E cos=EC, tramite un loro apposito calcolatore
reso disponibile in Internet, =E8 possibile derivare che per le necessit=E0
medie individuali europee di cibo, alloggio, trasporti, beni di consumo,
servizi e quant'altro si usi per vivere, =E8 necessaria un'area compresa tra i
6 ed i 7 ettari. Pur certo essendo rozza la misura, non possiamo non tenerla
ben presente negli importanti processi decisionali relativi alla nostra
Provincia e Regione. Si misuri la propria personale impronta ecologica
recandosi at:

http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm

2) Sia una economia che si attui localmente che una che si attui globalmente
hanno entrambe pregi e difetti. Non =E8 il caso di affrontare qui l'argomento,
ma vorremmo comunque ricordare che una economia locale rende la societ=E0 che
la pratica pi=F9 solida a fronte di una scarsa innovazione, una economia che
si basi su scambi con paesi lontani certo arricchisce ma allo stesso tempo
crea instabilit=E0 e dipendenza dall'esterno. Il clima di continua emergenza e
di folle rincorsa economica che oggi viviamo deriva in gran parte proprio
dallo squilibrio che si =E8 creato per aver dato troppo spazio all'economia
globale togliendolo a quella locale. Uno riequilibrio di queste due
componenti =E8 la scelta pi=F9 assennata cui ci si possa oggi dedicare in campo
economico. Bisogner=E0 dirglielo a Fazio, prima o poi.

3) In riguardo alla nostro sviluppo futuro, ci si permette di ricordare che
oggi, in tempi di scienza e non pi=F9 di forza bruta, esso =E8 favorito in
maniera enormemente maggiore da una crescita qualitativa delle persone,
quindi da una loro maturazione e preparazione intellettuale, che non da una
semplice crescita quantitativa della popolazione. Pi=F9 che favorire
quest'ultima, quindi, occorre coltivare ed organizzare meglio che si possa
la popolazione esistente: cos=EC facendo, persone che oggi sono persino di
peso alla societ=E0 ed emarginate diverranno domani in grado di compiere
autentici prodigi e di far da positiva guida ad altri.

4) Ci sia concessa un'ultima breve nota. Qualora lo studio confermasse ci=F2
che qui si ipotizza (che il nostro territorio sopporta gi=E0 troppa umanit=E0)
dovremo impegnarci ancor pi=F9, od iniziare di buzzo buono, a contribuire
a rendere migliori le condizioni di vita in quei Paesi i cui abitanti
avrebbero desiderato trasferirsi presso di noi. Magari, proprio
intensificando, od inviando per la prima volta, inviti temporanei a loro
rappresentanti per fornirli del tutto gratuitamente di conoscenze di cui
disponiamo che possono aiutare la loro Comunit=E0 a raggiungere una piena
autosufficienza.

Appello
ai Rappresentanti delle Forze Politiche

per la determinazione
di una densit=E0 demografica locale ottimale

---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---ooo---




Gentile Signore,


voglia gradire il nostro pi=F9 cordiale saluto! 


Come certo sapr=E0, negli ultimi mesi la popolazione mondiale ha raggiunto e superato i sei miliardi di unit=E0, quella dell'India il miliardo. Tali fatti, pur rappresentativi di una grave questione demografica che andrebbe affrontata con immediata ed estrema cura, non hanno invece goduto della necessaria attenzione pressoch=E8 da parte di alcuno. Anche la maggior parte delle persone e dei gruppi pi=F9 impegnati socialmente =E8 rimasta quasi del tutto indifferente davanti a ci=F2 che concorre fortemente al sorgere dei mali pi=F9 profondi della nostra epoca. 

Allo scopo di favorire il dibattito e la consapevolezza di un tema che urge di essere attentamente esaminato, =E8 stata dunque riassunta la questione sotto forma di una proposta di risoluzione allegata al sito Internet:

http://spg.hyperlinker.com/

con relativo Forum Internazionale di riflessione ed azione. 

Immaginando che anche Lei, come noi, stia sentendo questi stessi nostri impulsi di sano personale coinvolgimento, ci permettiamo ora di contattarLa nella speranza voglia trattare diffusamente tale tema all'interno del Suo Gruppo e nelle Assemblee amministrative e politiche locali. 

Lungi dall'essere, infatti, una questione coinvolgente soltanto luoghi lontani dalle nostre rispettive Regioni, il problema demografico, a meno di un immediato impegno generalizzato, coinvolger=E0 quest'ultime sempre di pi=F9, direttamente ed indirettamente, gli attuali fenomeni di immigrazione selvaggia che stiamo osservando in questi tempi essendo soltanto le prime avvisaglie di un fenomeno destinato a crescere ben oltre la nostra presente immaginazione, e lo stesso dicasi di fenomeni strettamente collegati alla crescita demografica come l'inquinamento ed il global warming. 

Anche per questo motivo, non solo quindi per contribuire a rimuovere le grandi sofferenze che accompagnano la crescita selvaggia della popolazione nei Paesi meno sviluppati, pensiamo che sia opportuno che la questione demografica internazionale vada affrontata a, e riceva l'apporto da, vari livelli. Essa deve essere discussa, chiarita e decisa, s=EC, in =E0mbito globale, con l'intervento di forze politiche nazionali e sovranazionali, ma anche in =E0mbito locale, con l'intervento delle forze politiche ed enti governativi provinciali e regionali, non dimenticando che ogni Regione d'Italia sta gi=E0 vivendo anch'essa, nella generale inconsapevolezza, un suo proprio grave problema demografico. 

Ed infatti, osservando la media nazionale Italiana, ricordiamo che (secondo dati del 1998) la densit=E0 abitativa della nostra nazione =E8 di ben 191 unit=E0 per kmq, la qual cosa equivale a dire che ogni Italiano, ripartendo idealmente il territorio della nostra nazione, dispone di una area di sole 0,52 parti di ettaro (trover=E0 i dati regione per regione in una cartina presente sul sito sopra segnalato) dalla quale trarre il fabbisogno alla sua vita (nota 1) e sulla quale esprimere il suo potere creativo. 

Anche se =E8 cosa piuttosto complessa determinare con metodo scientifico una densit=E0 abitativa complessiva ottimale o massima auspicabile per una societ=E0 e stabilire quanti individui un territorio possa sopportare senza degradarsi, col semplice sguardo d'insieme che ci viene dal vivere in prima persona questa situazione =E8 per=F2 facile capire come si sia gi=E0 da tempo superata una certa soglia minima di benessere e salubrit=E0 psicofisiche, nonch=E8 di sana indipendenza economica, giacch=E8 la vita degli Italiani, non bastando pi=F9 il loro territorio a soddisfare le esigenze di una popolazione in largo eccesso, dipende ormai ben pi=F9 da altre zone della Terra che dall'Italia stessa. 

Sarebbe pi=F9 che opportuno, quindi, avviare un solerte studio sulla situazione demografica locale, in ogni provincia e regione, sugli effetti, per nulla positivi, che la sovrappopolazione locale, non solo cittadina ma anche rurale, produce sugli individui stessi, la societ=E0 e l'ambiente. In tal modo sarebbe possibile attribuire finalmente una responsabilit=E0 ben precisa a tanti dei problemi ancora con paternit=E0 vaga che oggi ci assillano, e presentar loro le soluzioni che stavano aspettando. Allo stesso tempo sarebbe oltremodo auspicabile chiarire in che misura siamo reali figli della nostra terra ed in quale altra siamo invece dipendenti da lontane zone del mondo, per cercare di ristabilire, nel tempo, un sano equilibrio tra queste due modalit=E0 economiche (nota 2). 

Da questo studio emergerebbe immediatamente che una ulteriore crescita della popolazione locale (non importa se per motivi endogeni: ripresa della natalit=E0 locale, od esogeni: per immigrazione) aggraverebbe ulteriormente e terribilmente la nostra gi=E0 precaria situazione. In tal caso, questo stesso studio dovrebbe allora determinare un numero ottimale, dal punto di vista dell=92individuo, della societ=E0 e dell=92ambiente, di abitanti per Provincia e per l'intera Regione, cui far riferimento per ogni nostra incombenza di gestione presente e progetto di sviluppo futuro (nota 3). 

Pur consapevoli delle numerose implicazioni che una tale iniziativa comporterebbe, crediamo che la situazione locale e planetaria richieda un immediato ed intenso impegno in questa direzione. Crediamo anche che questo impegno di autodisciplina non solo assicurerebbe un sereno futuro alle nostre Regioni, ma fornirebbe anche un importante punto di riferimento sia ai Paesi meno sviluppati, affetti da crescita esponenziale della popolazione, che a quelli pi=F9 sviluppati, affetti da iperurbanizzazione, entrambi ancora immersi nel torpore, frastornati ed indecisi sulla direzione da prendere. 

Per tutto ci=F2, speriamo che la questione demografica emerga potentemente all'attenzione delle coscienze e diventi tema di diffuso dibattito locale, e cos=EC pure speriamo che lo studio qui auspicato diventi presto concreta realt=E0 (nota 4). 

Gentile Signore, ringraziandola profondamente per la sua cortese attenzione, ed augurandoci che questa nostra, pur modesta, iniziativa abbia incontrato presso di lei un qualche grado di consenso, le rinnoviamo il nostro miglior saluto.

Per un breve confronto, mentre un italiano (media nazionale) dispone di sole 0,52 parti di ettaro, un'area ben inferiore a quella che ognuno possa desiderare di, e sia opportuno, disporre, per ogni statunitense vi =E8 un'area di 3,44 ettari di territorio nazionale e per ogni australiano ben 50 ettari. Tutt'altra cosa avviene in India, dove ognuno dispone di 0,31 parti di ettaro, e nel Bangladesh, dove un essere umano dispone di soli 0,10 parti di ettaro, la qual cosa chiarisce molti tragici fatti che vediamo riportati nelle quotidiane cronache narrate dai media. 



NOTE 

1) Alcuni ricercatori della University of British Columbia, in Canada, hanno determinato, pur con larga approssimazione, la ecological footprint, l'impronta ecologica che un individuo, in base allo stile di vita che conduce, lascia sul territorio. E cos=EC, tramite un loro apposito calcolatore reso disponibile in Internet, =E8 possibile derivare che per le necessit=E0 medie individuali europee di cibo, alloggio, trasporti, beni di consumo, servizi e quant'altro si usi per vivere, =E8 necessaria un'area compresa tra i 6 ed i 7 ettari. Pur certo essendo rozza la misura, non possiamo non tenerla ben presente negli importanti processi decisionali relativi alla nostra Provincia e Regione. Si misuri la propria personale impronta ecologica recandosi at:

http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm 

2) Sia una economia che si attui localmente che una che si attui globalmente hanno entrambe pregi e difetti. Non =E8 il caso di affrontare qui l=92argomento, ma vorremmo comunque ricordare che una economia locale rende la societ=E0 che la pratica pi=F9 solida a fronte di una scarsa innovazione, una economia che si basi su scambi con paesi lontani certo arricchisce ma allo stesso tempo crea instabilit=E0 e dipendenza dall=92esterno. Il clima di continua emergenza e di folle rincorsa economica che oggi viviamo deriva in gran parte proprio dallo squilibrio che si =E8 creato per aver dato troppo spazio all=92economia globale togliendolo a quella locale. Uno riequilibrio di queste due componenti =E8 la scelta pi=F9 assennata cui ci si possa oggi dedicare in campo economico. Bisogner=E0 dirglielo a Fazio, prima o poi. 

3) In riguardo alla nostro sviluppo futuro, ci si permette di ricordare che oggi, in tempi di scienza e non pi=F9 di forza bruta, esso =E8 favorito in maniera enormemente maggiore da una crescita qualitativa delle persone, quindi da una loro maturazione e preparazione intellettuale, che non da una semplice crescita quantitativa della popolazione. Pi=F9 che favorire quest=92ultima, quindi, occorre coltivare ed organizzare meglio che si possa la popolazione esistente: cos=EC facendo, persone che oggi sono persino di peso alla societ=E0 ed emarginate diverranno domani in grado di compiere autentici prodigi e di far da positiva guida ad altri. 

4)	Ci sia concessa un=92ultima breve nota. Qualora lo studio confermasse ci=F2 che qui si ipotizza (che il nostro territorio sopporta gi=E0 troppa umanit=E0) dovremo impegnarci ancor pi=F9, od iniziare di buzzo buono, a contribuire a rendere migliori le condizioni di vita in quei Paesi i cui abitanti avrebbero desiderato trasferirsi presso di noi. Magari, proprio intensificando, od inviando per la prima volta, inviti temporanei a loro rappresentanti per fornirli del tutto gratuitamente di conoscenze di cui disponiamo che possono aiutare la loro Comunit=E0 a raggiungere una piena autosufficienza.

Cari amici,

come militante e deputato dei Verdi non posso che essere d'accordo con la vostra posizione che sosterr=F2 nelle sedi competenti. Da anni seguo con interesse i rapporti nord-sud del pianeta, a questo tema ho dedicato alcune conferenze e continuer=F2 ad occuparmene perch=E8 lo ritengo indispensabile per la sopravvivenza del pianeta e di tutta l'umanit=E0.
Vi ringrazio per la mail e vi invito a tenermi informato sulle iniziative che vorrete intraprendere per portare avanti questi contenuti affinch=E8 possa aderire.

Cordiali saluti
