>
>We send you our warmest greetings!
>
>
>As you certainly know, in the last few months the world's population has
reached and exceeded the amount of six billion units, that of India having
exceeded one billion. These facts, although they represent a serious
demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and extreme care, have
not been treated with the necessary attention by the general public. Even
the people and groups most socially committed are almost all indifferent to
that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most serious soc
>i
>ial illnesses of our era.
>
>Imagining that you, like us, are also feeling impulses of healthy personal
involvement, we permit ourselves to contact you at this point in the hopes
that you will want to treat this theme within your Group and in the
administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far from being an issue that
relates only to places far from our Nations, this demographic problem has,
in fact, for some time and in the general unawareness, fully expressed
itself also within those Nations, even made worse by heavily industriali
>z
>zed ways of life.
>
>And in effect, observing the average of the European Union, we remember
that (according to data of 1997) the population density of the whole
territory is of 127 individuals per square kilometer, that means that every
European, ideally dividing the territory of our Union, has at his disposal
an area of only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1) from which to get his life
needs (note 2) and on which to enjoy his individuality and to express his
creative power.
>
>It is rather complex to determine through a scientific method a total
optimal inhabiting density or the highest reasonable for a society, and to
establish how many individuals a territory can support without degrading
itself; however, with the simple comprehensive view we get by living this
situation personally, it is easy to understand that we have already for some
time exceeded a certain threshold of psychophysic wellbeing and healthiness,
and also of sound economic indipendence, since the European's li
>f
>fe, their territory no longer being enough to satisfy the exigencies of a
widely excessive population, by now depends much more from other zones of
the Earth than from Europe itself.
>
>For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the
current phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from
external overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is right
that the international demographic issue should be faced at, and should
receive contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed, made clear
and decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of overnational and
world political forces, being the problem of a planetary burden, bu
>t
>t also in a local ambient, at a national, regional and even provincial
level, observing both right and duty, as the demographic issue manifests
itself also locally and can find also locally effective solutions.
>
>In particular and to begin, it would be more than opportune to start a
diligent multidisciplinary study on the demographic situation, in every
Region and Nation, on the effects, not at all positive, that the local
overpopulation, not only urban but also rural, produces on the individuals
themselves, on the society and the environment. In this way it could be
finally possible to attribute a more precise responsibility to many of the
problems, still with a vague paternity, that worry us today, and to presen
>t
>t them the solutions they are waiting for. In the same time it would be
extremely auspicable to make clear in what measure we are real children of
our land and in what other we are instead dependent on far zones of the
world, in order to try to re-establish, with time, a sound equilibrium
between these two economic modalities (note 3).
>
>>From this study immediately it would emerge that our present demographic
density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals and that a
further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous motives:
restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would
ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In this
case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an optimal
number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual,
>th
>he society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the
whole European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our
errands of present management and plans of future development (note 4).
>
>Also aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would
involve, we believe that the local and planetary situations demand an
immediate and intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that
this engagement of self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to
our Nations, but would also furnish an important point of reference both to
the less developed Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of
population, and to the other more developed, generally affected, like w
>e
>e are, by hyperurbanization, both being still immersed in the torpor,
distracted and undecided on which direction to take.
>
>For all this, we hope that the demographic issue will rise powerfully to
the attention of our consciences and soon become theme of wide local debate,
and similarly we hope the study here augured will soon become concrete
reality (note 5).
>
>
>Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking you deeply for your courteous attention,
and auguring ourselves that this initiative of ours, though modest, has met
with you some degree of consensus, we extend to you our best wishes.

>NOTES
>
>1)      For a brief comparison, and starting with our Country: an Italian
(national average) has at his disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area
much smaller than everyone would wish to, and be opportune to, have at his
disposal. In this heavy, sad situation Italy finds inside the European Union
crowded companions in Germany (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42 hectares
per person), in England (243 inhabitants per square Km - 0.41 hectares per
person), in Belgium (310 inhabitants per square Km - 0.32
> hecta
>ares per person), and in Holland (457 inhabitants per square Km - 0.21
hectares per person). The European average is: 127 inhabitants per square
Km, equal to 0.78 hectares per person; the world average is: 44 inhabitants
per square Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per person (but mind that in this
count are considered also deserts and ice-caps, otherwise the area per
person goes down further: about 1.3 hectares).
>Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United
States in which every one has at his disposal still an area of 3.44 hectares
of national territory, and Australia, where every one can enjoy 50 hectares
(and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are also case of
atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has 0.31 parts of
hectare, and of Bangladesh, where a human being has only 0.10 parts of
hectare, the which gives light of greater clearness to many tragi
>c
>cal facts we see in the daily chronicles told by the media.
>
>2)      Some researchers of the University of British Columbia, in Canada,
have determined, even though with a large approximation, the ecological
footprint that an individual, based on the style of life he leads, leaves on
the territory. And so, through a special calculator available on the
Internet, it is possible to derive that for the middle european individual
needs of food, lodging, transports, consumer goods, services and what other
he uses to live, it is necessary an area between 6 and 7 hectares.

> though certainly the measure is rough, we cannot not keep it well in mind
in the important decisional processes relating our Region and Nations.

>
>3)      Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that
expresses itself globally have both values and faults. Here is not the place
to face this argument, but we would however remember that a local economy
makes the society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce
innovation; an economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries
certainly enriches but at the same time creates instability and dependence
from outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of insane economi
>c chas
>se we are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance
born from having given too much space to the global economy taking it away
to the local one. A re-equilibrium of these two components is the wisest
choice to which one could today dedicate himself in the economic field.
>
>4)      With regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to
remember that today, in times of science and no longer of brute force, this
development is favoured in an enormously greater way by a qualitative growth
of people, then by their intellectual maturity and preparation, that not by
a simple quantitative growth of population. More than favouring this last,
then, we need to cultivate and organize as best we can the existing
population: so doing, people that today may even be a burden for the
> socie
>ety and are abandoned will tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic
prodigies and to be a positive guide for others. Consider, moreover, that
after such a great exterior, material development like that reached by our
society, a natural organizational evolution, a real interior development,
must necessarily be added now, otherwise the former not supported by the
latter would fall down very soon on itself.
>
>5)      After about two months since the first drawing up of this call, we
received an excellent study entitled "Optimum Population for Europe" made by
David Willey, chairman of Optimum Population Trust. Setting about the
enterprise of the determination of an optimal local demographic density,
this more general study will be a great help. This study is available asking
for it at: inlingx(at)yipex.com or at Mr. David Willey, OPT, 12
Meadowgate, Urmston, Manchester M41 9LB, England.
>
>
>Concede us this one last note. In case the study would confirm what we are
here hypothesizing (that our territories already support too much humanity)
we must engage ourselves even more, or begin very eagerly, to contribute in
making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose inhabitants
would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying, or sending
for the first time, temporaneous invitations to some of them in order to
freely furnish them the knowledge that we have, that could he
>l
>lp their Community to reach a full self-sufficiency.
>At the same time, to avoid that our dutiful respect for an ideal
demographic density could even in the least thwart the positive process of
universalization of cultures and union of peoples that is already in act, we
should promote even more cultural exchanges of excellent quality (mostly
telematic, being immensely more effective than the simple transport of
organic matter activated by conventional tourism) with all the Countries in
the World.
