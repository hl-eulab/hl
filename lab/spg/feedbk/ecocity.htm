These facts, although they  represent a serious demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and  extreme care, have not been treated with the necessary attention by the  general public. Even the people and groups most socially committed are almost  all indifferent to that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most  serious social illnesses of our era. <BR><BR>Imagining that you, like us, are  also feeling impulses of healthy personal involvement, we permit ourselves to  contact you at this point in the hopes that you will want to treat this theme  within your Group and in the administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far  from being an issue that relates only to places far from our Nations, this  demographic problem has, in fact, for some time and in the general  unawareness, fully expressed itself also within those Nations, even made worse  by heavily industrialized ways of life. <BR><BR>And in effect, observing the  average of the European Union, we remember that (according to data of 1997)  the population density of the whole territory is of 127 individuals per square  kilometer, that means that every European, ideally dividing the territory of  our Union, has at his disposal an area of only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1)  from which to get his life needs (note 2) and on which to enjoy his  individuality and to express his creative power. <BR><BR>It is rather complex  to determine through a scientific method a total optimal inhabiting density or  the highest reasonable for a society, and to establish how many individuals a  territory can support without degrading itself; however, with the simple  comprehensive view we get by living this situation personally, it is easy to  understand that we have already for some time exceeded a certain threshold of  psychophysic wellbeing and healthiness, and also of sound economic  indipendence, since the European's life, their territory no longer being  enough to satisfy the exigencies of a widely excessive population, by now  depends much more from other zones of the Earth than from Europe itself.  <BR><BR>For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the  current phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from  external overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is right  that the international demographic issue should be faced at, and should  receive contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed, made clear  and decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of overnational and  world political forces, being the problem of a planetary burden, but also in a  local ambient, at a national, regional and even provincial level, observing  both right and duty, as the demographic issue manifests itself also locally  and can find also locally effective solutions. <BR><BR>In particular and to  begin, it would be more than opportune to start a diligent multidisciplinary  study on the demographic situation, in every Region and Nation, on the 
  effects, not at all positive, that the local overpopulation, not only urban  but also rural, produces on the individuals themselves, on the society and the  environment. In this way it could be finally possible to attribute a more  precise responsibility to many of the problems, still with a vague paternity,  that worry us today, and to present them the solutions they are waiting for.  In the same time it would be extremely auspicable to make clear in what  measure we are real children of our land and in what other we are instead  dependent on far zones of the world, in order to try to re-establish, with  time, a sound equilibrium between these two economic modalities (note 3).  <BR><BR>From this study immediately it would emerge that our present  demographic density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals  and that a further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous  motives: restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would  ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In this  case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an optimal  number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual, the  society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the whole  European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our errands of  present management and plans of future development (note 4). <BR><BR>Also  aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would involve, we  believe that the local and planetary situations demand an immediate and  intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that this engagement of  self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to our Nations, but  would also furnish an important point of reference both to the less developed  Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of population, and to the  other more developed, generally affected, like we are, by hyperurbanization,  both being still immersed in the torpor, distracted and undecided on which  direction to take. <BR><BR>For all this, we hope that the demographic issue  will rise powerfully to the attention of our consciences and soon become theme  of wide local debate, and similarly we hope the study here augured will soon  become concrete reality (note 5). <BR><BR><BR>Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking  you deeply for your courteous attention, and auguring ourselves that this  initiative of ours, though modest, has met with you some degree of consensus,  we extend to you our best wishes. <BR><BR><BR>Signature  Date<BR><BR>_____________________  __________________<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>NOTES<BR><BR>1) For a brief comparison,  and starting with our Country: an Italian (national average) has at his  disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area much smaller than everyone would  wish to, and be opportune to, have at his disposal. In this heavy, sad 
  situation Italy finds inside the European Union crowded companions in Germany  (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42 hectares per person), in England (243  inhabitants per square Km - 0.41 hectares per person), in Belgium (310 
  inhabitants per square Km - 0.32 hectares per person), and in Holland (457  inhabitants per square Km - 0.21 hectares per person). The European average  is: 127 inhabitants per square Km, equal to 0.78 hectares per person; the  world average is: 44 inhabitants per square Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per  person (but mind that in this count are considered also deserts and ice-caps,  otherwise the area per person goes down further: about 1.3 hectares).  <BR>Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United  States in which every one has at his disposal still an area of 3.44 hectares  of national territory, and Australia, where every one can enjoy 50 hectares  (and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are also case of  atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has 0.31 parts of  hectare, and of Bangladesh, where a human being has only 0.10 parts of 
  hectare, the which gives light of greater clearness to many tragical facts we  see in the daily chronicles told by the media. <BR><BR>2) Some researchers of  the University of British Columbia, in Canada, have determined, even though  with a large approximation, the ecological footprint that an individual, based  on the style of life he leads, leaves on the territory. And so, through a  special calculator available on the Internet, it is possible to derive that  for the middle european individual needs of food, lodging, transports, 
  consumer goods, services and what other he uses to live, it is necessary an  area between 6 and 7 hectares. Even though certainly the measure is rough, we  cannot not keep it well in mind in the important decisional processes relating  our Region and Nations. Measure your own ecological footprint going to: <BR><A  href="http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm">http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm</A>  <BR><BR>3) Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that  expresses itself globally have both values and faults. Here is not the place  to face this argument, but we would however remember that a local economy  makes the society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce  innovation; an economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries  certainly enriches but at the same time creates instability and dependence  from outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of insane economic chase  we are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance born  from having given too much space to the global economy taking it away to the  local one. A re-equilibrium of these two components is the wisest choice to  which one could today dedicate himself in the economic field. <BR><BR>4) With  regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to remember that today,  in times of science and no longer of brute force, this development is favoured  in an enormously greater way by a qualitative growth of people, then by their  intellectual maturity and preparation, that not by a simple quantitative  growth of population. More than favouring this last, then, we need to  cultivate and organize as best we can the existing population: so doing,  people that today may even be a burden for the society and are abandoned will  tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic prodigies and to be a positive  guide for others. Consider, moreover, that after such a great exterior,  material development like that reached by our society, a natural  organizational evolution, a real interior development, must necessarily be  added now, otherwise the former not supported by the latter would fall down  very soon on itself. <BR><BR>5) After about two months since the first drawing  up of this call, we received an excellent study entitled "Optimum Population  for Europe" made by David Willey, chairman of Optimum Population Trust.  Setting about the enterprise of the determination of an optimal local  demographic density, this more general study will be a great help. This study  is available asking for it at: <A  href="mailto:inlingua.opt@dial.pipex.com">inlingua.opt@dial.pipex.com</A> or  at Mr. David Willey, OPT, 12 Meadowgate, Urmston, Manchester M41 9LB,  England.<BR><BR><BR>Concede us this one last note. In case the study would  confirm what we are here hypothesizing (that our territories already support  too much humanity) we must engage ourselves even more, or begin very eagerly,  to contribute in making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose  inhabitants would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying, or  sending for the first time, temporaneous invitations to some of them in order  to freely furnish them the knowledge that we have, that could help their  Community to reach a full self-sufficiency. <BR>At the same time, to avoid  that our dutiful respect for an ideal demographic density could even in the  least thwart the positive process of universalization of cultures and union of  peoples that is already in act, we should promote even more cultural exchanges  of excellent quality (mostly telematic, being immensely more effective than  the simple transport of organic matter activated by conventional tourism) with  all the Countries in the World. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Data on the demographic  density are derived from:<BR><A  href="http://www.istat.it">www.istat.it</A><BR><A  href="http://www.worldbank.org">www.worldbank.org</A><BR><BR><BR>For updates  (also deriving from your precious feedback: thanks in advance!) and other  matter on the same theme, please see our web site:<BR><BR>The World  Demographic Issue<BR><A  href="http://www.hyperlinker.com/spg/pop.htm">http://www.hyperlinker.com/spg/pop.htm</A><BR><BR>Every  kind of contribution (adhesion, divulgation, articles, links, etc.) you can  give to this call will be very useful to favour the awareness on the European  heavy demographic situation.<BR><BR><BR><BR>This is an initiative<BR>by the  Eudaemony Global Researches Laboratory<BR><A  href="http://www.hyperlinker.com/eulab/labing.htm">http://www.hyperlinker.com/eulab/labing.htm</A><BR><BR>--##--<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>
