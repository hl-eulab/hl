Hi, Danilo:

Yes, I did receive your calendar, and I thank you.  It's quite interesting,
and I gave it to a friend who teaches third grade and who now uses it to
help her students understand the great diversity of cultures on our planet.

As far as the density question, my calculations indicate world land density
is just over 45 people per sq kilometer.  (Excluding Antartica!)  This
varies from a low of just over 3 per km in Oceania, to a high of over 116 /
km in Asia.  Europe is a bit over 32, and North America just over 16.

This is quite misleading, of course, because so much of the Earth's land
surface is inhospitable.  Because so few people live in the deserts,
tundra, rainforest, or extreme mountains, actual density in occupied areas
is far higher.

Best Regards,

John

Dear Danilo:

Good to hear from you, my friend.  

I'm afraid I no longer have the original data from the J Curve graph.  We
had a computer system change in our office, and in cleaning up items no
longer used, I deleted that graphic and spread sheet.  I can, however,
reconstruct it in time.  How soon would you need it, and what sort of time
intervals would your analyst prefer?  

Because it was intended merely to indicate a trend line, many of the
interim data were extrapolated from various estimates, and, therefore, do
not allow for the frequent and large-scale setbacks of famine and plague.
This means that accurately plotting shorter intervals would be nearly
impossible.  

Most of the original source data (from 10,000 BCE forward)is available from
UNDP at gopher://gopher.undp.org/00/ungophers/popin/wdtrends/histor%09%09%2B

and from the US Census Bureau at http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html

I hope all is well with you.  Please let me know how I may be of service. 

Best Regards,

John

Hi, Danilo:

Here are a couple of sites that may help with the road rage phenomenon.  The
first two are CNN pieces, and you may be able to turn up more with a search
on the CNN home page at www.cnn.com.   

http://cnn.com/US/9707/18/aggresive.driving/index.html  
http://cnn.com/US/9708/26/road.ignorance/   

http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/announce/testimony/aggres2.html  contains the
text of a speech by the NHTSA Administrator to the US Congress  in which he
states that 1/3 of all accidents and 2/3 of all fatalities in this country
are a result of road rage.  What's interesting, of course, is that while
highway overcrowding and congestion are listed as key factors in road rage,
nobody seems to tie it to the larger issue of population growth.

http://www.aaafts.org/Text/research/roadrage.htm is the summary of a study
by the American Auto Association.  The full text is also available from them at 
http://www.aaafts.org/Text/research/agdrtext.htm

I hope to make it back to Italy in the not-too-distant future.  I've been
fortunate enough to spend some time in Riva del Garda (perhaps near your
relatives?)  as well as in Como, Bellagio and other beautiful places around
the lakes.  My wife's family is from a little town named Roazio, just west
of Gattinara.  Italy is a ways off, however, because my next major journey
will be to Egypt in January.  That should be a very interesting trip, not
only because I am a history buff, but also because Egypt is a classic case
study of population issues.

Ciao and best regards,

John

Hi, Danilo:

Fall is lovely here.  Warm and sunny.  What we call an "Indian summer."  I
trust it is equally beautiful there?  (I have had the good fortune to be in
northern Italy  a couple of times during the months of September and
October, visiting family near Lago Maggiore and just traveling.  I hope to
do so again in the future.)

I'm afraid I'm not aware of anything that deals specifically with the
psychological impacts of population growth.  There is a large body of
evidence indicating correlations of social stress and human numbers, but it
all esentially deals with symptoms and physical manifestations such as "road
rage," crime rates, substance abuse etc.  

As you note, researchers are more comfortable with describing the impacts of
population density on other biological communities.  Perhaps that is because
of the variability and paucity of data - for example much of Asia has long
been far more densly population than most of Europe and North America, but
has not experienced  until recently the manifestations of overcrowding
stress.  One might suggest that it is a combination of lifestyle and
population which determines human reactions.  Or, perhaps, the phenomenon is
just too new in the human experience for us to be able to articulate it.
(Or perhaps too scary to admit?)

One thing that might be of some help is the work by the Peace and Conflict
Studies program run by Thomas Homer-Dixon at the University of Toronto.
(http://www.library.utoronto.ca/www/pcs/eps.htm)  They again document
symptoms, but the correlation of "environmental stress" and the resultant
psycho-social stress of population pressures are graphically apparent.

Hi, Danilo:

I had quite a good conference, thank you.  There was a lot of interest in
population issues among the environmental community.  I also made a number
of contacts that could further our distance learning projects.

As far as the graphic, attached is a jpeg I just threw together that I hope
will help out.  I'll build a better one in the not-too-distant future.
Caption should be: Graphic copyright Facing the Future, 1997

>When I read your WEB pages for the first time, the population growth graphic
>of PRB struck me strongly. As much, that I was planning to print adhesives
>with that image and few references, addresses, phone and a well constructed

Sounds good.

>Then: could you explain me more these two sentences?

Sorry, not the greatest syntax.  How about. . .

The greater the Earth's human population, the more food, water and energy we
require.  This means more land must be placed under cultivation, more
fertilizers and pesticides must be applied, and more water from rivers,
lakes and aquifers must be utilized for human needs.  It also means more
power plants must be built, and more oil, coal and natural gas must be
burned to produce energy.  The impacts of these actions include accelerated
destruction of natural areas, greater soil erosion and chemical runoff, and
increased air and water pollution.  Followed to its conclusion, this also
means decreased food production capacity, increased health problems, less
habitat and therefore loss of biodiversity, and generally lower quality of life.

As to the second. . .

Life expectancy was short - perhaps 25 to 30 years - and births were
essentially offset by deaths from hunger, accidents, disease or old age. 

I'll look at your new pages shortly.  Should be quite a test of my VERY
rusty Italian.

Ciao,

John

Greetings, Danilo!

Glad to hear you're going ahead with the project.   Perhaps in lieu of the
other sections initially, you might include the Introduction section, to
give people some sense of the connections between population and the
environmental issues they care about.  Please let me know if there's any way
I can help.

As far as the PRB graphic, you'll need to contact Stefanie Durbin
(stex(at)yg) for permission.  I intend to create one of our own in
the near future that can be reproduced without permission, but that's a few
weeks off.

I would suggest using only the J curve one (Population Growth Through
History) as the other (Time to Add Each Billion)  has been made somewhat
obsolete by the newest projections from the UN.  You might prefer instead to
use the updated World Population Projections graphic from our Trends page.  

My apologies for the delay in replying.  I've been traveling a bit, and am
leaving again tomorrow for five days to present at the North American
Association of Environmental Educators conference.

Best Regards.

Ciao.

John

ps.  please note my new e-mail address.  Our server can't differentiate
users by domain, so I had to change my user name at Facing the Future.

Dear Danilo:

Thanks for your prompt reply.  

Regarding reproducing our materials, our board president is amenable to your
program.  However, she suggested that at the very least you should include
"Population and the Environment," and "Economic and Social Impacts of
Population Growth" along with History and Solutions.  Without an
understanding of the ways human numbers interact with and exacerbate other
issues, the message is not nearly as strong, nor as urgent.   We have
learned in our work that people tend to accept the population message only
when they understand how it impacts things they already care about.

I would also argue for inclusion of "How Many People Can the Earth Support?"
and "Tracking the Trends" because those six segments make up the core of our
message.  I recognize that this makes your proposed project that much more
difficult, but would again stress that this issue must be seen in context,
and must touch people on both an intellectual and an emotional level for
them to accept it.

As far as the question of lowering impacts, this is an absolutely essential
component.  It's important to realize that even if population were to
stabilize immediately, global environmental impacts will still increase
dramatically as individuals and nations move up the ladder of economic
consumption and the food chain.  

Currently, the one billion people in the industrialized world consume a
significant majority of the world's resources.  But projections indicate
that this will shift over the next few decades as developing countries
modernize their economies and production capabilities.  The majority of
carbon emissions, for example, are currently produced by industrialized
nations.  But by around 2000, the developing world will catch up and become
the largest carbon emitters.   

Just as developing countries will increase their energy use - and resulting
emissions - so will their increased affluence change the patterns of
personal consumption.  As economies expand and people begin to have
disposable income, they increase both their technology base and their
consumption.  

For example, in China, economic expansion and increased personal incomes for
a significant percentage of the population are leading to a change in
housing, transportation and eating habits.  Because they have more money,
people want bigger houses with more modern conveniences, such as televisions
and refrigerators.  In order to build that housing, land must be obtained
(usually by converting farmland) and resources exploited and processed.  

Bicycles are giving way to motorcycles, and motorcycles to automobiles,
which results in more emissions, as well as a need for more land for roads,
parking, repair shops and petrol stations, all of which must come largely
from conversion of farmland or wild habitat.   Also, as China seeks to
produce its own motorcycles and automobiles, it must generate more energy
(typically from coal, with tremendous environmental impacts in the form of
smog, acid rain and climate change) as well as convert more land for
factories.  (Ford recently signed a contract to build an auto plant in China
that will pave over thousands of hectares of very rich farmland.)

And people who once subsisted primarily on rice now desire animal protein -
poultry, pork and beef - all of which take far more grain to produce.  This
demand for more grain drives demand for more farmland to produce it, which
comes from conversion of forests or other wild habitat.  It also results in
more fertilizers and pesticides applied, and increased pressures on aquifers
and other water sources.

This same cycle of unsustainable development is occurring throughout the
developing world.  I think we have to remember that multinational
corporations see the nearly five billion citizens of developing regions as a
tremendous future market.  And that free trade is shifting income to those
areas at a rapid rate.  (And who would argue that those five billion people
aren't entitled to pursue the same levels of comfort, affluence and security
that we in the industrialized world enjoy?)

Perhaps the easiest way to explain all this to your audience is through
Holdren and Ehrlich's formula, I = PAT (Impact equals Population times
Affluence times Technology).

If technology and affluence remain static but population increases, impacts
obviously increase.  But if population remains static while affluence and/or
technology increase, impacts also increase.   Today, all three factors are
in play in developing countries.  There are more people, a rising level of
economic development, and an increasing threshold of technology.  

All of which is a long way of saying that the problems of overpopulation,
unsustainable development patterns, environmental degradation, and social,
economic and gender inequity are completely intertwined.  We can't simply
work on one out of context and expect to solve the problem.  If we don't
work on all the aspects of the problem simultaneously, we simply can't
solve it.  

And, by showing people how their own actions and lifestyles contribute to
the problem, we not only move toward solving it, but also move away from the
idea that it is someone else's problem.

I look forward to your thoughts on this.

Best Regards,

John

Dear Mr. D'Antonio:

Thank you for your mail and kind comments regarding our web page.  We would
be interested in your publishing our materials in Italian and disseminating
them via the web and your listserve.  

Are there specific components of our site you would like use, or are you
interested in the entire content? Unless you have a specific portion in
mind, you might want to check out our updated site which is scheduled to
come on-line next week  You can preview it at
http://www.facingthefuture.org/test/index.html.

Please let me know any specifics so that I may clear them with my board.
Assuming that no difficulties are encountered, I can e-mail you the original
text files for translation.  I am the author of all the material on our site
with the exception of the Curriculum Guide, part of which was cooperatively
developed with a number of teachers and advisers.

Best Regards,

John Goekler
Executive Director
