Dear Sir or Madam

Thankyou for contacting Dr. Hare but I am afraid population is not his 
area of expertise. Dr. Hare is the Climate Policy Director and works 
on the political side of Greenpeace International's climate campaign. 

There is no-one who addresses population issues directly within 
Greenpeace - it is an area we have chosen not to addreess. However 
it may be worth contacting our European Unit at eex(at)ygl3
as they may be able to provide you with some contact information. 
Good luck with your research. 
Regards
Roma Baker
Political Unit Assistant

> As you certainly know, in the last few months the world's population has reached and exceeded the amount of six billion units, that of India having exceeded one billion. These facts, although they represent a serious demographic issue that should be faced with immediate and extreme care, have 
not been treated with the necessary attention by the general public. Even the people and groups most socially committed are almost all indifferent to that which contributes heavily to the rise of the most serious social illnesses of our era. 
> 
> Imagining that you, like us, are also feeling impulses of healthy personal involvement, we permit ourselves to contact you at this point in the hopes that you will want to treat this theme within your Group and in the administrative and politic local Assemblees. Far from being an issue that 
relates only to places far from our Nations, this demographic problem has, in fact, for some time and in the general unawareness, fully expressed itself also within those Nations, even made worse by heavily industrialized ways of life. 
> 
> And in effect, observing the average of the European Union, we remember that (according to data of 1997) the population density of the whole territory is of 127 individuals per square kilometer, that means that every European, ideally dividing the territory of our Union, has at his disposal an 
area of only 0.78 parts of hectare (note 1) from which to get his life needs (note 2) and on which to enjoy his individuality and to express his creative power. 
> 
> It is rather complex to determine through a scientific method a total optimal inhabiting density or the highest reasonable for a society, and to establish how many individuals a territory can support without degrading itself; however, with the simple comprehensive view we get by living this 
situation personally, it is easy to understand that we have already for some time exceeded a certain threshold of psychophysic wellbeing and healthiness, and also of sound economic indipendence, since the European's life, their territory no longer being enough to satisfy the exigencies of a 
widely excessive population, by now depends much more from other zones of the Earth than from Europe itself. 
> 
> For these reasons of internal overpopulation, without forgetting the current phenomena of wild immigration onto European ground, deriving from external overpopulation and certainly destined to grow, we think it is right that the international demographic issue should be faced at, and should 
receive contribution from, various levels. It must be discussed, made clear and decided in a global ambient, with the intervention of overnational and world political forces, being the problem of a planetary burden, but also in a local ambient, at a national, regional and even provincial level, 
observing both right and duty, as the demographic issue manifests itself also locally and can find also locally effective solutions. 
> 
> In particular and to begin, it would be more than opportune to start a diligent multidisciplinary study on the demographic situation, in every Region and Nation, on the effects, not at all positive, that the local overpopulation, not only urban but also rural, produces on the individuals 
themselves, on the society and the environment. In this way it could be finally possible to attribute a more precise responsibility to many of the problems, still with a vague paternity, that worry us today, and to present them the solutions they are waiting for. In the same time it would be 
extremely auspicable to make clear in what measure we are real children of our land and in what other we are instead dependent on far zones of the world, in order to try to re-establish, with time, a sound equilibrium between these two economic modalities (note 3). 
> 
> From this study immediately it would emerge that our present demographic density has already reached and exceeded evident danger signals and that a further growth of the local population (whether for endogenous motives: restarting of local birth-rate, or exogenous: for immigration) would 
ulteriorly and terribly overburden our already precarious situation. In this case, even if it is late, this same study should then determine an optimal number, for our epoch and from the point of view of the individual, the society, and the environment, of inhabitants per Nation and for the whole 
European Union, that can serve as a point of referral for all our errands of present management and plans of future development (note 4). 
> 
> Also aware of the numerous implications that such an initiative would involve, we believe that the local and planetary situations demand an immediate and intense engagement in this direction. We believe also that this engagement of self-discipline not only would secure a serene future to our 
Nations, but would also furnish an important point of reference both to the less developed Countries, generally affected by exponential growth of population, and to the other more developed, generally affected, like we are, by hyperurbanization, both being still immersed in the torpor, distracted 
and undecided on which direction to take. 
> 
> For all this, we hope that the demographic issue will rise powerfully to the attention of our consciences and soon become theme of wide local debate, and similarly we hope the study here augured will soon become concrete reality (note 5). 
> 
> 
> Kind Madame, kind Sir, thanking you deeply for your courteous attention, and auguring ourselves that this initiative of ours, though modest, has met with you some degree of consensus, we extend to you our best wishes.

> 
> 1)	For a brief comparison, and starting with our Country: an Italian (national average) has at hi
s disposal only 0.52 parts of hectare, an area much smaller than everyone would wish to, and be opp
ortune to, have at his disposal. In this heavy, sad situation Italy finds inside the European Union
 crowded companions in Germany (235 inhabitants per square Km - 0.42 hectares per person), in Engla
nd (243 inhabitants per square Km - 0.41 hectares per person), in Belgium (310 inhabitants per squa
re Km - 0.32 hectares per person), and in Holland (457 inhabitants per square Km - 0.21 hectares pe
r person). The European average is: 127 inhabitants per square Km, equal to 0.78 hectares per perso
n; the world average is: 44 inhabitants per square Km. equal to 2.27 hectares per person (but mind 
that in this count are considered also deserts and ice-caps, otherwise the area per person goes dow
n further: about 1.3 hectares). 
> Inside the planetary situation, there are cases as those of the United States in which every one 
has at his disposal still an area of 3.44 hectares of national territory, and Australia, where ever
y one can enjoy 50 hectares (and we hope they will be able to preserve them); but there are also ca
se of atavic carelessness as those of India, where every one has 0.31 parts of hectare, and of Bang
ladesh, where a human being has only 0.10 parts of hectare, the which gives light of greater clearn
ess to many tragical facts we see in the daily chronicles told by the media. 
> 
> 2)	Some researchers of the University of British Columbia, in Canada, have determined, even thoug
h with a large approximation, the ecological footprint that an individual, based on the style of li
fe he leads, leaves on the territory. And so, through a special calculator available on the Interne
t, it is possible to derive that for the middle european individual needs of food, lodging, transpo
rts, consumer goods, services and what other he uses to live, it is necessary an area between 6 and
 7 hectares. Even though certainly the measure is rough, we cannot not keep it well in mind in the 
important decisional processes relating our Region and Nations. Measure your own ecological footpri
nt going to:

> 
> 3)	Both an economy that expresses itself locally and one that expresses itself globally have both
 values and faults. Here is not the place to face this argument, but we would however remember that
 a local economy makes the society that practices it more solid but gives it a scarce innovation; a
n economy that bases itself on exchanges with distant countries certainly enriches but at the same 
time creates instability and dependence from outside. The climate of continuous emergence and of in
sane economic chase we are living today derives in great part just from the lack of balance born fr
om having given too much space to the global economy taking it away to the local one. A re-equilibr
ium of these two components is the wisest choice to which one could today dedicate himself in the e
conomic field. 
> 
> 4)	With regard to our future development, we permit ourselves to remember that today, in times of
 science and no longer of brute force, this development is favoured in an enormously greater way by
 a qualitative growth of people, then by their intellectual maturity and preparation, that not by a
 simple quantitative growth of population. More than favouring this last, then, we need to cultivat
e and organize as best we can the existing population: so doing, people that today may even be a bu
rden for the society and are abandoned will tomorrow become able to accomplish authentic prodigies 
and to be a positive guide for others. Consider, moreover, that after such a great exterior, materi
al development like that reached by our society, a natural organizational evolution, a real interio
r development, must necessarily be added now, otherwise the former not supported by the latter woul
d fall down very soon on itself. 
> 
> 5)	After about two months since the first drawing up of this call, we received an excellent study
 entitled "Optimum Population for Europe" made by David Willey, chairman of Optimum Population Trus
t. Setting about the enterprise of the determination of an optimal local demographic density, this 
more general study will be a great help. This study is available asking for it at: inlingx(at)y
l.pipex.com or at Mr. David Willey, OPT, 12 Meadowgate, Urmston, Manchester M41 9LB, England.
> 
> 
> Concede us this one last note. In case the study would confirm what we are here hypothesizing (th
at our territories already support too much humanity) we must engage ourselves even more, or begin 
very eagerly, to contribute in making better the conditions of life in those Countries whose inhabi
tants would have wished to move next to us. Maybe, just intensifying, or sending for the first time
, temporaneous invitations to some of them in order to freely furnish them the knowledge that we ha
ve, that could help their Community to reach a full self-sufficiency. 
> At the same time, to avoid that our dutiful respect for an ideal demographic density could even i
n the least thwart the positive process of universalization of cultures and union of peoples that i
s already in act, we should promote even more cultural exchanges of excellent quality (mostly telem
atic, being immensely more effective than the simple transport of organic matter activated by conve
ntional tourism) with all the Countries in the World.
