Among my project is associate editor of New Rennaissance - a journal that
comes out from Germany. Do you mind if I send your piece to them for
possible publication.

In addition, I am co-editor of the Journal of Futures Studies. I would be
pleased to get a piece from you on the subject of demographics, debt,
futures etc. Would you have anything like that that you are looking for a
publication site for?

Thanks

bread or a drop of water, and that, mainly for this reason, are affected by
endemic violences, are also those that, with its peoples still now subdued
by a crude law of nature that leads them to an almost forced reproduction,
greatly go on elevating the number of the inhabitants on the planet.

with the poorest Countries, not only with their governments (as too often
they aim almost only at making grow their armies), but directly and
diffusely with the peoples themselves. It should be a dialogue aiming to
show the atrocities (for the individuals) following a wild reproduction and
the tremendous demographic situation (for the whole planet).

campaign of demographic awareness. Such an opportunity could not re-present
