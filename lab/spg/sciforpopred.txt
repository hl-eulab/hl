Kind Mr. Brad Bartholomew,

I send you my best greetings.

I would ask you if it could be possible to be added among the Sci for Pop
Reduction members (below I report an invitation by Mr. Steve Kurtz).

My web site on overpopulation is at:

http://spg.hyperlinker.com/

Below is a little note on me, and in another message I send you for
acquaintance a "Call to the European Political Forces and Governmental
Organizations for the determination of an optimal local demographic
density".

My most distinguished greetings,

Danilo D'Antonio

Danilo D'Antonio (1953) is a philosophical promoter and consultant.
Autodidact, he is an expert in well-being techniques, for body and soul, for
the individual and the society. Author of several articles and essays, he
contributes to national and foreign reviews of philosophy and science of
psyche. Globalist, futurist, he is involved, besides in development of
techniques for personal growth, also in the search for an integration
between science and religion, for new forms of economy, of politics and of
social organization, and in themes of global interest like the demographic
issue, operating a needed synthesis among them and beginning a modernization
process of their approach methods. Suffering for a serious form of
polyarthritis, helped by his wife and few intimate friends, he promotes
various cultural initiatives, belonging to, and operating with, wide
international social movements engaged in promoting human evolution and a
positive transformation of the world.
