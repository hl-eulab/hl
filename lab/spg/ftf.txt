Dear Mr. D'Antonio:

Thank you for your mail and kind comments regarding our web page.  We would
be interested in your publishing our materials in Italian and disseminating
them via the web and your listserve.  

Are there specific components of our site you would like use, or are you
interested in the entire content? Unless you have a specific portion in
mind, you might want to check out our updated site which is scheduled to
come on-line next week  You can preview it at
http://www.facingthefuture.org/test/index.html.

Please let me know any specifics so that I may clear them with my board.
Assuming that no difficulties are encountered, I can e-mail you the original
text files for translation.  I am the author of all the material on our site
with the exception of the Curriculum Guide, part of which was cooperatively
developed with a number of teachers and advisers.

Best Regards,

John Goekler
Executive Director
