From every where, continually, appeals for the economical and technological development appear. Countries, whose economies are the most advanced in the world and who gained enormous richeses, continue to pursue to every cost a further development. Government people, chiefs of state, mature persons, often elderly, that in every case should wisely invite to the prudence, to the calm, to the moderation, push whole peoples to a continuous, in the facts disastrous, race for the economical and technological supremacy. 

<br><br>

Every human relation inside our societies is being destroyed, and even the most pacific and for their original virtue most disinterested persons, those who never would have look at anyone in a avid manner, are instigated and lead by every person in power to transform theirselves in rapacious individuals, the one in competition against the other, being thrown in a hunt without end up to the last customer.

<br><br>

Why all this?

<br><br>

The authentic reason cannot surely be searched in a longing towards a better quality of life, this quality being already drastically reduced, the same life being bocome at risk for the frenetic rhythms to which human beings are compelled and for the havoc of the natural world. Nor we can find such reason in the fact that in the most developed Countries still there are poor persons. This is certainly not for the insufficient level of the reached economical development, but for a missed fair redistribution of the work, and of the incomes that derive from it, among all the components of the society.

<br><br>

And perhaps can we find the authentic reason of the thoughtless spur to a development to the death in the pure desire to bring the well-being in the not yet developed Countries? May be in the finding of working hands almost at zero cost, in the opening of new markets, and in the exploitation of new territories. And can we still believe that a "sustainable development" does really exist? A development like that presently conceived, where the variables to be developed are always and only those demographic, economical, and technological? It is a beautiful invention, certainly, but good only for the fools. If the Countries still in course of development well do to leave their present conditions, well different our future development will have to be.

<br><br>

We hiper-developed peoples, by reasoning with honesty, can well focus the true reason, the only really valid motive of our race for the development, that in effects coincides with the greatest problem of our societies, and then we can find also the most appropriate, the most right solution.

<br><br>

It exists, indeed, a valid reason that has lead us up to now along the road of an economical/technological development to every cost. This reason consists in the fact that it is necessary to avert the real danger of a commercial invasion first and of a successive total oppression of one's own Country by any other Country of the world that is in a condition to run swifter. It is a concrete danger, that perfectly explains also because the Governments continue stubbornly to pursue a demographic growth. It is a danger that must be tackled with the greatest engagement, by beginning to openly and diffusely declare the tragic human reality and by taking therefore the due measures.

<br><br>

Rather than to continue to pursue a blind growth of the economy, of the technology, of the population, a kind of development that lead so it happens today cannot end than in damage for everyone of the peoples of this Planet, the Governments must concentrate their own energies in the stipulation of indissoluble agreements among the nations, agreements that lead us to a peace of very superior level and conception to that till now we have pursued.

<br><br>

Such agreements necessarily must include rules of economical, technological and demographic self-containment. We must act in order that every Country, in concert, give itself constitutional means to self-discipline itself in a manner that be impeded their potential overflow in the other people's territories. We must found appropriate international rules and commissions that with objectivity hold under control the levels of the different kind of development reached and attainable from every Country. And naturally, there where possible, we must supply a good example, by beginning from us ourselves and from our same Country, by beginning just with the demographic field.

<br><br>

This is the true, the most important challenge of our period. This is the direction that we should follow. Because our destiny will be determined on the base of these agreements, and we all will be able to definitely win the race for the development thanks to these agreements.
