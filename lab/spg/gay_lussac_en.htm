We have <a class="underline" href="invitation.htm#nota2">already seen</a> that some researchers have determined the <i>ecological footprint</i> that an individual, in base to his style of life, leaves on the territory, and calculated that for the medium individual European necessities of food, lodging, transportations, consumer goods, services and whatever we use to live, it is necessary an area between the 6 and the 7 hectares. Already from arguments of this kind it is obvious that our Countries have exceeded every limit (for example, we remember that in Italy, ideally dividing its territory, everyone has at his disposal an area of only 0,52 parts of hectare) reaching a quite superior density to the advisable one.

<br><br>

Besides the problems relative to the ecosphere, to the incidence of the overpopulation on nature, we must also consider the effects on the same population: on the individuals and so like on their social organization. And with reference to this, we may find enlightening to consider humans confined in a territory like they were molecules of a gas holded inside a container. The laws that govern gases seem in fact justly right to have an idea, surely vague but always provided with a certain degree of validity, of the destiny that can await, among the others, also the European population.

<br><br>

Particularly, we should consider the connection that tie up the volume, the temperature and the pressure of a gas: maintaining stable the volume, the pressure grows by growing the temperature. We remember now that the temperature of a gas is strictly connected to the movement of its molecules. A gas has a temperature more or less high according if its molecules move themselves more or less swiftly. By warming a gas, it happens just an augmented velocity of its molecules. Well, in this historical moment, the main problem for us human beings is just in the increase of heat, of energy, furnished by the high economic and technologic development we have reached and in the increased total temperature of our society.

<br><br>

Every individual has today private means of transportation and of tools of communication, work and fun that increase enormously his private and social activity, and more in general his mobility, his vivacity, not only physical but also simply telematical. And the "energy" owned by the individual sums up till to lead the "temperature" of the whole social system to exasperated levels. In the gases, by growing the temperature equally the pressure increases. The molecules in fact agitate themselves more and more frenetically, striking themselves more and more stronger the ones with the others, and beating more and more stronger the container itself that holds them. And also in our society, by growing the temperature equally the pressure increases. The human beings in fact agitate themselves more and more frenetically, striking themselves more and more stronger the ones with the others, and beating more and more stronger the container itself that holds them. If for what regards gases the container coincide only with the phisical recipient, because the molecules are disposed caotically inside it, in our case we must consider at the risk not only the phisical recipient, that is the natural environment, but also the social organization that contains all of us.

<br><br>

Already for some time we can observe in our society that every individual is submitted to such a pressure by the other individuals to fill up with patients the medical studies and to empty medicinal out of the pharmacies for the numerous pathologies deriving by the stress, how it is generally called the pressure to which everyone of us is submitted to hide its mainly demographic origin. And equally the environment and the society suffer for it, both being more and more unstabilized by evident ills of every type.  

<br><br>


In a situation like this, while the temperature goes on to grow, that is while economical development and technological progress advance, if we increase also the mass of the gas, that is the number of the molecules, that is the number of the persons, the explosion of the whole system is already certain. Multiply all this for the number of Countries affected with overpopulation and economical and technological hyper-development and sit down calmly waiting, surely not for a long time, for a fantastic planetary explosion!

<br><br>

Remember then this rule:

<br><br>

AT CONSTANT VOLUME THE PRESSURE OF THE GAS GROWS IN A DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL MANNER TO THE INCREASE OF THE TEMPERATURE.  

<br><br>

That is:

<br><br>

AT CONSTANT TERRITORY THE DEMOGRAPHIC PRESSURE GROWS IN A DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL MANNER TO THE ECONOMICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.

<br><br>

If we want to avoid the explosion of a gas, we have preliminarly to let flow out a certain number of its molecules from the volume that contains them, simultaneously slowing down the ascend of the temperature. Equally, if we want to be certain to avoid the disintegration of our system, we must preliminarly await that the number of the persons, of a society like that global of the planet, diminish for being spent the natural cycle of their life, slowing down in the meanwhile the economical and technological development.
