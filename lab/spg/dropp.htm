For some time, and the more we go forward the more the tide rises, the awareness of the need to erase the debt that the poorest Countries would have to the more developed is asserting itself in our minds.

<br><br>

Seing the conditions of both the fronts, those opulent of the north/occident and those scanty of the south/orient, this feeling naturally seems to be more than justified, also as we cannot forget that the firsts however have done, during the centuries, a wide exploitation of the natural and human resources of the seconds.

<br><br>

To this almost common feeling, we fully share, we would now add a very brief consideration.

<br><br>

We all know, and not ever an instant should be spent without this awareness, that our planet is by now extremely overpopulated and the growth of the number of its inhabitants remains still now teribly high.

<br><br>

We do not want forget the harmful influence of the economic activities of the more developed Countries for that regards the uncertain future of our world. However, paradoxically, we also note that just the less developed Countries, just those where it is almost impossible to find a crumb of bread or a drop of water, and that, mainly for this reason, are affected by endemic violences, are also those that, with its peoples still now subdued by a crude law of nature that leads them to an almost forced reproduction, greatly go on elevating the number of the inhabitants on the planet.

<br><br>

Until now practically nothing has been done (mainly for dread to incur in various antipathies) to try to improve this situation and arrange to limit births that are destined or to precocious and atrocious deaths for hunger, ills and wars, or in the best of hypotheses to make heavy an already overloaded planet.

<br><br>

Now, with the proposal to abolish the debt, and with the great prominence in the world wide ambit that this noble deed would have, a great opportunity appears to the more developed Countries. Erasing the weight of the debt, we, in the meantime, should also establish a direct dialoghue with the poorest Countries, not only with their governments (as too often they aim almost only at making grow their armies), but directly and diffusely with the peoples themselves. It should be a dialogue aiming to show the atrocities (for the individuals) following a wild reproduction and the tremendous demographic situation (for the whole planet).

<br><br>

We should specifically and diffusely illustrate the benefits of the reproductive self-discipline, starting from the fact that an offspring more numerous today doesn't mean a greater wealth, as may be it could occur hundred years ago, but certainly a greater poverty.

<br><br>

That share all of us on this planet: let population grow, today, without make nothing to try stabilizing it, doesn't mean at all to develop mankind but, on the contrary, deteriorate it, may be even definitely.

<br><br>

We cannot waste, then, the opportunity to join to the noble deed of the annulment of the debt that similarly noble to begin a serious world wide campaign of demographic awareness. Such an opportunity could not re-present itself in useful time.
