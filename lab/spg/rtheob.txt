Herewith a brief note.

If we cannot reduce the pressure of population, all our other efforts will 
be made far more complex. We need to be providing everybody who is ready to 
limit the size of their families with the ability to do so. We should aim 
for every child to be a wanted child.

Some people downplay the population issue arguing that the overconsumption 
issue is more critical. It is true that the developed world needs to use 
less resources. But both efforts must go forward together.

I commend Danilo for his effort to make this issue more visible and hope 
you will work with him.


Blessings and Peace,
Robert

We need new goals for the 21st century: a high quality of life, social 
cohesion, ecological integrity and effective decision-making. These will 
only be possible within a radically new way of seeing the world from an 
organic, system-theory, spiritual viewpoint. For more on this see:
