Either we are all saved or no one is saved

When we see so many people going to great lengths to save one man alone, we can understand how powerful, disorienting and dishonest the journalists and their media (both official and alternative) are indeed. At this moment on Earth an ocean of ​​people (including the same Peoples of Countries at war with each other) are suffering for the atrocities committed by the so-called deep-states: from the castes/mafias of people hired-for-life in jobs that, being a collective national property and so great their influence on the fate of everyone, cannot be granted definitively but only for a short period of time. So that a wide participation can balance and control what every employee has done. De facto on Earth a naked and pure Mankind is everywhere oppressed by de-humanized people hired-for-life in the centrality, by the illegitimate bosses/owners of our Republics. A global conflict is active between these two forces: strong bureaucratic despotic tyrants vs weak citizens free humans. And nobody can become so important on Earth to gather all the attention for himself and factually obscuring the greater reality that oppresses the world. We must become aware to be all victims of the journalists and their media, not only when they show us an official truth but also when they present an alternative truth. In both cases journalists disorient us. They prefer to mythologize a man or a situation rather than reveal the biggest truth that solves all problems: the time is arrived for humans to free themselves all from the deep-states, by opening everywhere Banks of Public Jobs in order to alternate rigorously pro tempore!

That said, best wishes, Mr. Assange! Get out early.<br>
Together we will quickly drive out all tyrants of the world.
