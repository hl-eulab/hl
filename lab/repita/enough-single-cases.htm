ENOUGH SINGLE CASES!

</font>

<br><br><br>

It's long time that the trick of amassing popular attention around specific cases of injustice or violence made by the state-men (by unduly owners of a centrality that instead must be public: participated only pro tempore) is being used in order to distract people from the general rule, by respecting which no pitiful case would arise.

<br><br>

And so it urges to say once and for all: specific, individual, personal cases should not matter to us! This is a perfidious political strategy to direct the attention of the masses towards a single spectacular case so that they don't note that there is no person on Earth who does not live oppressed, tyrannized, harassed by the illegally hired-for-life in jobs that must be instead regularly returned to the people. There are so many ugly people who continue to blind the consciences by illuminating a single case but always leaving in the dark the fact that the entire Planet is still waiting to be freed from the public criminals, from abjects who never give back to the Sovereign People what to the People belongs: the Res Publica. Personal, individual, specific cases of injustices perpetrated by hired-for-life (everywhere thieves of the Public Thing) are absorbing every attention, every human energy for decades, keeping the progress of our Country and the whole world blocked for well over half a century.

<br><br>

I rephrase: we are victims of a precise strategy that focus our attention on a media bouncing case, so that we do not realize that we all are still living under the tyranny of the life-long-hired in still fake-public jobs. The spotlight continues to be directed on the single case instead of illuminating the whole Res Publica which is still owned by a caste and mafia of eternal immovable careerists. As if we were still in the midst of the tyrannical era.

<br><br>

Therefore let us pay attention, yes, to the individual cases but for the purpose of finding other evidences of a General Rule that can save all of us: the hired-for-life in the public sector, both in our Country and in the rest of the world, must be all immediately fired and, through the creation of Banks of Public Jobs, suitable and respectable people should begin to alternate for a fixed term. Then there won't be anymore a single injustice on Earth! Because every public employee will check and rebalance the work of the previous one, without being blinded by the stable job and the promise of growing career and power. No one dare to present himself with only his own personal problem, forgetting the tragedy that is experienced all over the globe and which is at the origin of the same bloody war in progress. Stop drawing attention to ourselves alone! Enough of this immature self-centeredness! Either we use our own case as an opportunity to talk about the general problem that afflicts all of us, or we work hard to free everyone, or no sympathy be granted to the egocentric anymore. By now we all are risking freedom and life on the Planet: so no one continue to present himself as a blind, selfish, presumptuous man. Never again.
