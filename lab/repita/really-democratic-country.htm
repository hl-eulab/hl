ANYONE HERE INTERESTED TO<br>A REALLY DEMOCRATIC WORLD?

</font>

<br><br><br>

You can see right away if your Country is democratic or if it just pretends to be. If your Republic (res publica in the ancient language) is shared property of the citizens, who alternate as equal partners through a Public Jobs Bank, then yes! Your Country is truly democratic. And everything works wonderfully for you. But if the Republic is held captive, possessed by a caste of hired-for-life, by a closed congregation of bureaucrats, of careerist, true monarchs, well: where would Democracy be? Where is the periodic renewal of personnel in the public roles (as required by Democracy without any possibility of exception) which gives rise to the citizens participation?! It is always the old monarchical state, lopsided, squared off, crooked, where those who are well are always better off and those who are ill are always worse off. It is the old tyrant state unduly remained due to a continued abuse of power by the Republic's own jailers. In such a Country it doesn't matter if the governments keep changing. If the Republic (the public offices, institutions, jobs, powers and incomes) are always in the hands of the same people as long as they live, there will never be equality, justice, freedom. Don't you think you should stop ignoring all this?!

In accordance with the theory of the social patent (which advances humanity just as the industrial patent did with technology) each Laboratory project has a price. Information on its Internet domain.

Every law firm in the world<br>
become a spokesperson of the illegality<br>
of the transfer for life of that common good<br>
which is the Republic with its<br>
jobs, powers and incomes.
