ORIGIN AND END OF MILITARISM

</font>

<br><br><br>

Every day, all over the world, countless people are engaged in the fight against militarism. Generations of pacifists have battled militarism. The result? Wars have always emerged robustly, and when they ended, it was more due to the exhaustion of the contenders’ resources than to any heed paid to the protesters’ demonstrations.

<br><br>

The stark reality is that desire and will alone are not enough. They must be guided by three abilities: the capacity to observe reality, to analyze those observations, and to synthesize a just, logical, and implementable change capable of leading us into the new cultural, political, and social dimension in which we wish to live.

<br><br>

Have pacifists ever linked the militarism they so oppose to military careerism? This practice, from feudalism, empires, and monarchies to the present day, has not only remained in excellent shape but has also grown over various historical periods, extending to the point of erecting a vast state careerism—the sole cause of the failure to democratize power. Even today, every sphere (except the legislative) remains, as in the times of tyrannies, granted for life to a minority to domineer at will over the majority.

<br><br>

It is urgent to recognize that voting does not make Democracy. It is the temporariness of every public role—whether operational or decision-making, whether granted through hiring or elections—that opens the doors of the central authority to a regenerative flow of skilled and prepared citizens capable of sweeping away all division, conflict, and despotism.

<br><br>

Life is wonderful; it can be set right immediately if, with an act of humility, we acknowledge our mistakes and pledge not to repeat them. It is urgent to recognize that only the legislative power was made democratic with time-limited assignments, while every other central power—administrative, cultural, educational, informational, financial, fiscal, judicial, public order, military, repressive, punitive, healthcare, scientific, statistical, agricultural, ecological, construction, urban planning, landscape, etc.—has never been democratized and, to the great shame of those who have entrenched themselves in it and refuse to relinquish it, still heavily influences the thoughts and actions of every government.

<br><br>

Democracy, through the participation enabled by temporary mandates, will transform every country in the world, dissolving all internal and external conflicts as soon as citizens recognize that they have blindly and mindlessly followed more than one generation of leaders who directed them against something but never built a new society. Then, they will see the path forward on their own, without backward-looking political or cultural figureheads.

<br><br>

All careerists, bureaucrats, and lifelong hires who constitute the fallen monarchical state must be dismissed immediately. Let us introduce a regular and rigorous temporary mandate for every hiring in roles rightfully called public. Let us make the central authority, the holy Republic, open and participatory as it should be, and we will have nothing left to regret. A government will begin to legislate finely when it is surrounded by attentive, caring, and proactive citizens following the snowden model, rather than uncritical, loyal, medieval careerists in the style of priebke.

<br><br>

The res publica belongs to all; it cannot be the private property of careerists, denying access to others with equal rights and qualifications. It is enough to reclaim it—no more is needed than to demand it continuously (just as Black people won their rights and women won the vote)—increasingly raising awareness that everything depends on us and no one else. Every power of the Republic must finally be made democratic: granted only for a limited time.

<br><br>

Whoever has held it for themselves has abused the power they had. They have deceived, betrayed, defrauded, and robbed every Italian, stalling the evolution of an entire planet. They must now face the legal consequences of their misdeeds.

In accordance with the theory of the social patent—which advances Humanity just as the industrial patent advanced technology—every Laboratory project comes with a price. Details are available on its Internet domain.

<br><br>

Peacefully, legally, and civilly, Italy,<br>the EU, and the entire planet will evolve.

<br><br>

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid,<br>osmotic, participatory, and lived. Serene.

Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank!

<br><br>

And hurrah for Danilo too! The only researcher, politician, activist in the world who opens the doors of the Republic to citizens, enabling them to succeed one another, suitably qualified, to monitor, improve, and verify the work of those who came before them, preventing injustice and allowing everyone to learn and grow every day. Long live Danilo! The only one who guarantees every human on Earth a minimum share of power. Long live Danilo! And the Earth finally spins as it should.
