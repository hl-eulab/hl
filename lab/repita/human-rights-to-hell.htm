"HUMAN RIGHTS" TO HELL!

</font>

<br><br><br>

Yes. The servants, the slaves, beg for rights. Free humans never are compelled to ask.

<br><br>

Do you know who are those who always affirm human rights? They are persons who have intention to keep humans away from the power, so distant and separate from it that they still need to ask for "rights". They are people who force Mankind to play still in defense while it is something else that belongs to us who live in this phantasmagoric era. Every human being, today, can and must assert the principle that the Centrality of public jobs/powers must be accessed strictly pro tempore. If our res publica is eternally in the hands of tyrants (of rotten individuals who never return to their home) it is clear that humans will be forced to beg for rights.

<br><br>

But if we establish the truth: that every public job/power cannot remain forever in someone's hands but it must be regularly returned to the Country, to the People, because this is asserted by the co-ownership Law and because this rule works both in the interest of the individual and of the community (since every tyranny sooner or later leads to the most total ruin) every human will automatically gain the benefit of having power for a certain time. That is: to participate concretely in the public life of his own Country. And by so happening ... who will need more "human rights"?! Human rights are for those who cannot acces their res publica! But if we can access (certainly being idoneous to the specific role) to the Centrality of the public jobs, all immediately changes. If someone dares to harm us, we will rush inside our Republic and from within it we will immediately remedy the problem. Do you understand the big difference? If human rights were once necessary to get us this far, today those same rights (and above all those filthy associations that have made themselves eternal assertors of rights) stand as a barrier to the progress which consists in our becoming aware of being co-owners of our Republic, so of our public jobs/powers, and therefore to can access them on an equal footing with any other.

<br><br>

And just thus we become masters of our destiny!

<br><br>

Well. So, when you see someone who still claims for human rights, now you are clear about his value. It is a matter of being primitive and retrograde as well as stubbornly intent on keeping the world that way. Does perhaps the absolute exist? Isn't the world constantly evolving? Millions of scientists should stand up to help us to apply in the everyday life the principle that everything is relative. But, "idiot savant" as they are, (as they follow more and more restricted specializations) remain accurately silent. It is up to us, extraordinary nothingnesses, to tear the world from the pit into which all these narrow gauge humans have sunk it. Therefore ... long live those who always find in themselves the energy to say: to hell the past, long live the present! Sole maker of a bright future.

Hurrah for Danilo! The only human in the world who helps Mankind to evolve. Hurrah for Danilo! The only who opens to the citizens the doors of their Republic. Hurrah for Danilo! The best friend you have in the whole world!
