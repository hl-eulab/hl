ART! CULTURE! WHERE ARE YOU?

</font>

<br><br><br>

With all the great and small artists in circulation, with all the celebrated, paid, rewarded, revered intellectuals, scattered throughout the world, there is still no one to help us understand that in Democracy there cannot be eternal owners of the public jobs/powers/roles! That there can be no careerists, no monarchs, no tyrants. Otherwise we don't live in Democracy because there isn't a Republic co-owned by every citizen but still the archaic monarchical state that remains always exclusive property of a caste and mafia of hired and elected for life, inevitably despotic when not completely dictators.

<br><br>

What is then the use of an art and a culture that distract people, make them waste time and therefore trust, never adding something meaningful and resolving? What can we do with an art and a culture that have no mercy on a world so wretched and tragic only because it has been maintained and it is remained ignorant, now even affected by retrograde impulses? Simply because we can't go on.

<br><br>

Actors, producers, directors and screenwriters, philosophers, novelists, essayists and publishers, singers, comedians, entertainers and presenters, documentarians, photographers, cartoonists and madonnaries, graffiti makers, ice sculptors, cloud painters, poets all love, heart and panettone .. what are you for if you fill our minds with images and thoughts that are garish but devoid of content, if you leave the world in the tyranny of those hired and elected for life in roles that are public and must regularly returned to the Sovereign People?! Only in this way the participation being possible.

<br><br>

Wherever in the world these tyrants remain, wherever a marked there is despotism when not exactly a heavy dictatorship, wherever oppression, harassment or outright violence there is, wherever the will of the person is erased, everywhere a public centrality lacks, everywhere people are ousted from their own res publica, wherever there is need for an Institution such as the Public Jobs Bank, which allows citizens to do their part and to carry out public life, independently, without having to give in to the wishes of a blinded mass ... and you don't care and indeed you don't even know what we are talking about here now?! You yourselves are so inept that when you blow on politics you throw the public against some ruler you dislike (above all because he doesn't feed you) as if the problem were only there and not first of all in the casta and mafia of those hired-for-life in a still-today-fake-public, perennial masters of every Institution!

<br><br>

No. There is an urgent need for artists and people of integrity who have developed themselves in the round, having their eyes and ears directed everywhere. May they understand and cry for the nothing they have done so far, become aware of their inaction and immediately and massively remedy to that.

<br><br>

Excellent, rationalizing, sublime or at least switched on sensitivities and brains ... stop just lounging in cotton wool! It's not good art, it's not true culture, anything that leaves the world as it is, that deceives humanity and ends up making it worse. It's not good art, it's not culture, everything that is silent than the more its urgency screams. Of how much the world needs real Democracies and real Republics.

In accordance with the theory of the social patent (which advances humanity just as the industrial patent did with technology) each Laboratory project has a price. Information on its Internet domain.

Peacefully, legally, civilly,<br>
let's make the whole Planet evolve.

<br><br>

Hurray for the Public Jobs Bank!

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid,<br>
osmotic, participated, lived. Se-re-ne.
