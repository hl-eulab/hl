PLANETARY DEMOCRACY

</font>

<br><br><br>

Let us immediately build all over the world real Democracies, true Republics.

<br><br>

Let us commit ourselves in every corner of the Planet in order to chase away, to dismiss, to fire, all the hired for life in the still fake-public jobs of our respective Countries. Times like these tell us that we cannot act each in his own Country. We must unite ourselves globally not to simply contrast or oppose but to win over the supranational organizations (cultural, economic, financial, political, scientific) that rule the world, even erasing the will of our single Countries. And we can do that only by building true Republics.

<br><br>

Let us claim that wherever Public Jobs Banks are established. In which competent, prepared, suitable citizens can alternate themselves pro tempore. Nothing will ever be the same. Nobody will be able to harm humans anymore. The governments, politicians, do not count so much and do not last long. On the contrary the careerists, the bureaucrats, the life-long state-men are extremely dangerous: they are eternal and always ready (clinging to the permanent position and with spasmodic desire for career and power) to blindly act by canceling every human right.

<br><br>

If we want to see the whole World evolve, as it never happened in the past three quarters of a century, all that we need to do is to focus all of us on this one only goal. Don't waste any more time chasing a vain everyday politics, don't get stuck where the great thinkers of the past stopped. Day after day let us remain focused constantly confirming our full desire that every employee hired-for-life in our Countries be definitively fired. Dismiss them now! Let us fire them all!

<br><br>

It must become a saving mantra for every human being on the Planet. We have a precious Single Democracy Indicator: if in the public jobs/powers/roles there is no regular renewal, there is no Democracy. It is not the people to decide their fate. We must make really democratic our Countries: which Republic be no longer owned by aristocratics, by a casta of careerists, but participated at a fixed-term by citizens all suitable for the role they choose.

<br><br>

If we work, we do it! Blacks made it, with slavery. Women too, with the vow. Why today shouldn't we, all humans together, sortie from our narrow categories, emancipate ourselves from tyrannical centralities, therefore despotic, by interrupting every hiring for life?

<br><br>

Thanks everyone and good luck!

In accordance with the theory of the social patent (which advances humanity just as the industrial patent did with technology) each Laboratory project has a price. Information on its Internet domain.

<br><br>

Hurray for the Public Jobs Banks!

<br><br>

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid,<br>
osmotic, participatory, lived! Serene.

Hurrah for Danilo! Still the only researcher, politician, activist in the world who opens the doors of their Republic to human beings: so that suitable people can follow one another also to control and improve the work of those who preceded them. So preventing any injustice and everyone being able to learn something more every day. Hurrah for Danilo! The only who guarantees a minimum power to every human on Earth. Life will have well other colors than the present gloom.
