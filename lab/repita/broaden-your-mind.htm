BROADEN YOUR MIND, SAVE THE WORLD!

</font>

<br><br><br>

Very little minds have those who take care for someone alone and not for all humans. They do not understand or don't care at all for the fact that, even if their dear will become free, other millions/billions people will continue to be oppressed by the state-men: by medieval careerists hired-for-life in our public jobs, the same ugly people who forms the deep-state that keeps in jail your pal. Wars still happen, millions still dye, being our world under the tyranny of the eternal bosses who own our public centralities, and a lot of insane minds, piloted by the journalists clique and by other people who never used their own minds to comprehend the world, think to free one man alone! The whole of humanity is crying and screaming to free itself from the grip of the old tyrannical states ... and you think only about your friend?! Shame to all of you! You are the shame of the Galaxy. You are so insensitive to not see that your Republic is still an exclusive property of the casta and mafia of the wicked people all illegally hired-for-life. Instead to blindly repeat what other repeat, begin claiming for a Public Jobs Bank in your Country! Let prepared citizens succeed one another pro tempore in every res publica. And all our world will be free and save. Instead of a man alone. Instead of your so precious friend solely.
