A New Interpretation of World Facts

<br><br><br>

While anti-EU sentiment continues to simmer almost everywhere and Europe flounders in every area, gripped by a fundamental intellectual dishonesty that prevents it from formulating a viable strategy, intervention is urgently needed. Let’s immediately present the broad, overlooked landscape that experts fail to see because they are unwilling to delve intodeem uncomfortable and unexplored.

<br><br>

Let us proceed swiftly. To the west, we are still well-positioned. It is towards the East that we have never turned with the necessary energy and foresight. Considering how high and fast the Sun rises in the East, we must act immediately so that, when it is above the EU, it does not cast a shadow and begin to rain down upon us.

<br><br>

The best way to approach the East is to show them as soon as possible that we have decided to do what we have never done before: open the Res Publica (first the public jobs) of our individual countries and the EU apparatuses to the orderly and regular participation of citizens who are fit and prepared for the role. This requires dismissing all life-long appointees in the pseudo-public sector and strictly re-hiring other competent people on fixed-term contracts through the nascent Public Jobs Bank (PJB). Without introducing strict temporariness in the assignment of public positions, nothing will fundamentally change for the better on Earth.

<br><br>

From Italy to the USA to Myanmar and every other corner of the globe.

<br><br>

It is always the lifetime appointees, the career bureaucrats, the sovereigns/tyrants unduly remaining in the Republic, who are the first to practice despotism at their leisure and to allow even the worst politicians to do as they please. Therefore, we in the West must finally become what we should have been 80 years ago: truly democratic nations, where citizens enjoy a genuine Res Publica and are no longer subjected to an imperial/monarchical state owned by a protected caste of life-long appointees and despotic tyrants.

<br><br><br>

And Now Comes the Prize!

<br><br>

Once we in the West have evolved, the people of the countries in the other hemisphere will inevitably want to do the same! They, too, will be freed from that closed, immobile, and immutable system—oppressive and vexatious—that is even worse on their side of the world than on ours. Once Italy is made democratic (if given a helping hand, it could be the first), followed by the other EU countries and the EU itself, and once our territories have torn down the great wall made of former granite-like lifetime appointees in the public sector, every other territory, even at the antipodes, will be led to do the same.

<br><br>

At that point, East and West can unite into a single body: connected by a great network of communication, commercial, cultural, decisional, and functional channels—for work and tourism. No longer closed, monolithic, antiquated, opposed states—crude and violent—but rather supportive and secure, modern, resolute Republics. Authentic Democracies.

<br><br>

A courageous leap forward is therefore urgent.

<br><br><br>

The Path to Evolution

<br><br>

Until now, evolution has been blocked by an intellectual class focused on making the Universe gravitate around their permanent positions and careers, solely to increase their own power. There is an underlying order in things, concealed by them, that could allow Humanity to live without friction, much like the splendid technological systems that already adhere to that order.

<br><br>

We must, therefore, bypass the learned intellectuals and accredited experts (who are often banal, conformist, and homogenized), and begin to reason in a rigorously non-professorial, genuine, and truthful manner. Humanity will then become unrecognizable. From emotional and irrational, it will become reasonable and secure. Ultimately, it is enough to open up and dynamize societies by driving out the thieves of the Res Publica and opening it to a concrete and substantial popular participation, allowing many a genuine public life, and everything will become fluid and perfectly functional!

Let every law firm in the world speak out<br>
for the illegality of the life-long transfer of that common good<br>
that is the Republic, with its jobs, powers, and incomes.

<br><br><br>

In accordance with the Social Patent Theory (which advances Humanity just as the Industrial Patent has done with technology), every project of the Laboratory has a price. Information is available on its site: <a class="noline" HREF="../mercato/index.htm" target="market">http://market.hyperlinker.org</a> Peacefully, legally, and civilly, Italy is evolving—and with it, the entire Planet will follow. Long live the Public Jobs Bank! And long live Danilo! He is the only one who opens the doors of the Republic to its citizens: allowing eligible people succeed one another, thereby controlling, improving, and verifying the work of their predecessors. This prevents all injustice and allows everyone to learn something new every day. Viva Danilo! He is the only one who guarantees a minimum power to every human on Earth. He will never sit in a parliament nor be a careerist, yet the entire world is changing through his efforts alone! Simply by clarifying, reordering, and explaining. Hurray for Danilo! The world takes on far different colors than the current bleak ones, and the Earth finally rotates as it should.
