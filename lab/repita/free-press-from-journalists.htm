FREE PRESS! YES, BUT WITHOUT JOURNALISTS!

</font>

<br><br><br>

Journalists around the world call for a "free press." But in truth, the press will only be free when it is freed from journalists. Humanity does not need journalism that seeks to justify its own existence by constantly focusing on governments. Instead, awareness must spread that human beings have the full right—if competent and suitable—to access their Res Publica. This means, above all, access to public jobs through the regular renewal of all personnel via pro tempore democratic assignments. Only in this way can citizens check and improve the actions of those who came before them.

<br><br>

We urgently need Public Jobs Banks in every country in the world. A system where citizens rotate in and out of public roles ensures that no one can build unchecked power, carry out injustices, start wars, or commit atrocities. With a continuous flow of people, information and news will freely enter and exit the walls of public institutions.

<br><br>

A fundamental rule of universal good sense states that it is not so much who governs that matters, but who surrounds those who govern. Democracy exists only if citizens have access to their rightful powers, to all public roles. Otherwise, despite declarations to the contrary, it is still a monarchy, a disguised tyranny. This is what journalists should be stating at the beginning of every article. But instead, they choose to remain part of the problem rather than become part of the solution.

<br><br>

These scoundrels—resolute complicit in this outdated and unjust system—continuously raise a wall of meaningless daily reporting, preventing us from addressing what truly matters: lifelong employment in the public sector is an illegal, monarchical, tyrannical practice. Those who still hold our respective Republics hostage are criminals—thieves, and swindlers.

<br><br>

So, journalists, wake up! Stop being an obstacle to humanity’s progress! Reset what you think you know and start studying again—not through books that have already been printed, but rather those still to be written.

Peacefully, legally, civilly,<br>
let us advance, evolve and progress<br>
our Country, Continent and the whole Planet!

Peacefully, legally, and civilly, let us advance, evolve, and progress—our Country, our Continent, and the entire Planet! The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid, osmotic, participatory, and lived. Se-re-ne. Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank!

And hurrah for Danilo, too! Still the only one (after thirty years of uninterrupted solitary campaign) who opens the doors of the Republic to citizens, enabling them to take turns, monitor, improve, and verify the work of those who came before them. This prevents injustice and allows everyone to learn and grow every day. Hurrah for Danilo! The only one who guarantees every human on Earth a minimum share of power. He will never sit in a parliament, yet he is changing the world all by himself! Simply by clarifying, reorganizing, and explaining. Hurrah for Danilo! The world is beginning to take on brighter colors, and the Earth is finally spinning as it should. In accordance with the theory of the social patent—which advances humanity just as the industrial patent advanced technology—every Laboratory project comes with a price. If those who make truly advance, evolve the world, Humanity, do not become filthy rich, how can we ever direct Humans towards this sacred holy goal?
