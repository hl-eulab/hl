"WE ARE ALL ASSANGE", someone says ...

</font>

<br><br><br>

Mankind indeed is not Assange. Assange is fighting for himself. And you too, here. Instead every human today has the duty to defend not only one man but the whole Mankind. Assange has the same problem that all we humans have: to be compelled to live under the tyranny of the hired for life in the never become public employments. The whole world is under their tyranny, all the world is suffering great disgracies and immense tragedies (including wars) for the dictatorship deriving from the hired for life in the never become public employments ... and we should forget the world and defend one only man?! But what do you think? That there are only idiots in the world? Everyone who defends one only man does everyone else an injustice. Assange! It is time you set aside your archaic, by now outdated, crypted wikileaks and help all humans to tell the truth face uncovered! Under the bright light of the Sun. Democracy there is when the res publica is shared, participated pro tempore, enjoyed by many and not owned by some. So, dear Assange, stop distracting your fanatics and tell them: let us dismiss, let us fire all state-men, all bureaucrats, all state-careerists, now! Let's throw down the deep states! Let us open everywhere Banks of Public Jobs where people can alternate themselves and then the whole truth will spread at last all over the world!
