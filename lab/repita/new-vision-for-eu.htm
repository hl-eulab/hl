A NEW VISION FOR OUR COUNTRIES AND THE EU

</font>

<br><br><br>

The Problem: A Broken System

<br><br>

Our societies are trapped in a deep crisis, not because of complex mysteries, but due to a simple truth: powerful groups—elites, lobbies, and insiders—control politics and governments. They shape laws to serve their interests, creating rules that are unfair, excessive, and disconnected from the needs of ordinary people. These laws are enforced by a state apparatus that acts more like a monarchy than a true democracy. Permanent bureaucrats and careerists, loyal to their positions rather than to the public, uphold this system with unquestioning obedience.

<br><br>

This is not a "Res Publica"—a shared public good—but a structure that stifles our freedom and joy.

<br><br><br>

The Solution: Citizens in Charge

<br><br>

We don’t need endless debates or elaborate theories to fix this. The answer is straightforward: replace lifelong bureaucrats with competent citizens who take turns serving in public roles. Imagine a system where public jobs are not lifelong careers but temporary responsibilities, rotated among qualified individuals. This would break the grip of entrenched power and restore democracy to its roots.

<br><br>

To make this real, we propose a Public Jobs Bank: an online platform where citizens can apply for temporary public roles based on their skills and commitment to the common good. By alternating in these positions, we ensure that no one becomes a permanent ruler, and fresh perspectives keep the system dynamic and accountable.

<br><br><br>

Why It Matters

<br><br>

When citizens, not careerists, hold public power, governments will naturally focus on what truly matters: creating fair, balanced, and rational laws that serve everyone. These rules would be simple, constantly refined, and designed to foster trust and cooperation. Instead of rigid enforcers, we’d have thoughtful stewards who prioritize the public’s well-being.

<br><br>

This shift would transform not just our countries but the European Union itself. A democratic EU—open, participatory, and vibrant—can only emerge from nations built on true citizen involvement.

<br><br><br>

The Risk of Inaction

<br><br>

If we ignore this opportunity, we leave the door open to frustration and division. Without change, distrust will grow, fueling simplistic and divisive movements that threaten the EU’s unity. We can choose a better path: a peaceful, legal, and democratic evolution toward shared governance.

<br><br><br>

A Call to Action

<br><br>

Let’s build the Public Jobs Bank together. Let’s create systems where public power is temporary, transparent, and accountable. By empowering citizens to shape their own future, we can revive our democracies and lay the foundation for a stronger, more united Europe.

<br><br>

Life can be wonderful when we build it with care. Let’s start now.
