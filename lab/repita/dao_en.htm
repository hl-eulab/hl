The Public Jobs Bank as a DAO and the Role of UI

Instead of trying to make a tyranny work,<br>let us build a true Democracy and Republic.

<b>Introduction</b>

<br><br>

Lifetime employment in the public sector is a practice rooted in pre-democratic times, when power was the immutable prerogative of a closed caste. This practice has survived to this day due to politicians equally determined to perpetuate their power for life. Public employees hired for life and rulers elected for life have deliberately concealed the co-ownership nature of every public position. Such positions cannot be permanently assigned or enjoyed without becoming private property, resulting in a definitive loss for contemporaries. This system has denied many citizens, with equal rights and professional qualifications, the opportunity to participate in the management of common assets.

<br><br>

The result is an immutable, rigid, and oppressive system that has always been suffered, failing to respond properly to life’s necessities or adapt to its continuous and often unpredictable changes. This inadequacy leads to prolonged frustration and, ultimately, violent reactions. Inequality, despotism, and inefficiency generate distrust in institutions and democracy itself, which is effectively murdered by the ancient practice of permanently holding power.

<br><br><br>

<b>The Vision of the PJB</b>

<br><br>

To leave behind the era of tyranny and establish a true Republic, we propose the creation of a Public Jobs Bank (PJB)—an institution designed to manage and regularly redistribute every public position. It will ensure continuous renewal of public structures through a digital platform. The PJB establishes an open, fluid, proactive, and adaptable system.

<br><br><br>

<b>Goals of the PJB</b>:

<br><br>

- Fair redistribution of public roles, based on candidates selected over time for skills, merits, and needs.

<br><br>

- Collective participation in the management of public assets, by an osmotic process that creates community and accountability.

<br><br>

- Functionality and adaptability of the public sector, enabling quick responses to crises and economic or social changes.

<br><br><br>

<b>Legal Foundation of the PJB</b>

<br><br>

The idea of the PJB is rooted in a solid legal foundation anchored in the principle of co-ownership of public goods (res publica) by citizens. Each public position, as common property, cannot be permanently assigned to a segment of the population, depriving others of the opportunity to access it. A system that treats public goods as private property violates the principle of common ownership and transforms what is public into private. The PJB is designed to eliminate this illegality and affirm the public and shared nature of all roles within the central structure.

<br><br><br>

<b>The PJB as a DAO and the Role of UI</b>

<br><br>

To realize this vision (so long after the emergence of the many 'republics' on Earth!), we propose the creation of a prototype PJB. This prototype will be developed by a new Institution based on the model known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This approach effectively utilizes blockchain technologies and artificial intelligence tools to achieve:

<br><br>

- Democratic Management: Decisions are made through distributed voting, ensuring equal participation and representation.

<br><br>

- Resource Dynamics: Smart contracts manage documented assignments of public roles.

<br><br>

- Economic Incentives: Internal tokens reward contributors to the system, ensuring its growth and sustainability.

<br><br><br>

<b>UI and Optimization</b>

<br><br>

The integration of Universal Intelligence (UI) within the PJB will leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and optimize the assignment of roles, continuously adapting to societal needs and fulfilling the legitimate desires of participants. UI will ensure fairness, identify inefficiencies, and provide data-driven insights for the continuous improvement of the system.

<br><br><br>

<b>Short-Term Goals</b>

<br><br>

- Launch a public awareness campaign to attract necessary institutional support.

<br><br>

- Create a community of developers, independent of existing pseudo-public structures.

<br><br>

- Develop a functional prototype of the PJB managed as a DAO.

<br><br>

- Test the system within restricted areas to verify its effectiveness.

<br><br><br>

<b>Call to Action</b>

<br><br>

The PJB introduces a necessary change for those who truly abhor tyranny. It democratizes (and modernizes) our entire public sector and inevitably will gradually transform whole world positively. If you share this vision and have political influence, or possess technical, legal, managerial, or financial expertise, express your interest in contributing to the development of the PJB.
