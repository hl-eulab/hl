Someone tells<br>that every journalist is in danger,<br>if Assange is.

</font>

<br><br><br>

Well: it is a real pleasure to know that every journalist is in danger. Yes, I sign this. Because if in all these decades at least some journalists had told to their readers that only the apex of a public centrality is democratic, because given temporaneously, while the whole iceberg below is constituted by tyrants: by burocrats, by careerists hired for life, things today would be very different.

<br><br>

For all of us on Earth.

<br><br>

A centrality is made up of 99% of public employees hired for life while governments are only a temporary minority, who will never go where the state-careerists do not want. Directly or indirectly, in infinite different ways, by inculcating all of us since we are children, these tyrants condition the legislative power and impede the evolution. Those who want to change things need not think only of governments and individual members of them. It is not by renewing only the legislative power that life will heal on Earth. Instead this will quickly happens by starting to periodically renewing every other central power: administrative, cultural, educational, informative, fiscal, judicial, ecological, public order, military, repressive, sanctioning, building, urban, health, statistical, etc.

<br><br>

Dear great Journalists, do not speak only about the facts! Learn us instead to DREAM really democratic Countries: true Res Publica! Dear Journalists, you are indeed part of the same system that menace you. If you continue to deceive your readers, really you are deceiving yourselves. Dear Journalists, stop focusing us on politics, on governments. Show us instead the old tyrant state below!
