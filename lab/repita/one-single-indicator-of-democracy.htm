THE UNIQUE DEMOCRACY INDICATOR

</font>

<br><br><br>

When culture is held captive by a closed clique of monopolizers, truth is methodically marginalized, and the various phenomena of life end up becoming incomprehensible. Confusion grows slowly until it becomes devastating. Just as it is today. For instance: to determine the degree of an ever-unclear, never-explained "democracy" in a country, experts, professionals, and technicians resort to using dozens of indicators. All equally detached from what is truly the essential principle of Democracy. To the point that one cannot grasp the method to achieve it.

<br><br>

Yet all things, even the most complex, when we strive to break them down and reduce them to a degree of elemental simplicity, become easily digestible and understandable once more, making it far easier for us to face life. Thus, in contrast to the thousand complex methods employed by celebrities to gauge a country’s level of "democracy," we immediately find the indicator capable of determining, with numerical precision, the percentage of Democracy actually realized and establishing its quality with the most decisive of definitions.

<br><br>

THIS INDICATOR IS PRECISELY GIVEN BY WHETHER OR NOT A PUBLIC, DECISION-MAKING, OR FUNCTIONAL ROLE IS PERIODICALLY RETURNED TO THE PEOPLE TO WHOM IT BELONGS.

<br><br>

In the case of our beloved Italy, assuming the total number of public employees amounts to 3,500,000 (a figure encompassing both appointed officials and elected representatives, though only the latter are regularly returned to the nation), we can easily calculate the level of Democracy as a percentage relative to the full value achievable by returning all central public roles to the Sovereign People. Likewise, the places where Democracy is absent are identified with absolute precision.

<br><br>

For example: in the administrative and judicial fields (but also in education, information, taxation, public order, military, repressive and punitive systems, as well as healthcare, science, statistics, agriculture, ecology, construction, urban planning, landscaping, energy, and so forth), there seems to be no trace of Democracy whatsoever. Because not a single role, not a single public position, is yet regularly returned to the Italian People. This would ensure due participation and the necessary renewal of personnel.

<br><br>

So that each person, in turn, might directly experience what it means to endure, as an ordinary citizen, the rules set by Parliament and then enforced by those appointed to the Res Publica.

<br><br>

Instead, both the appointed and the elected do everything they can to focus minds solely on legislative power (politics), ensuring no one notices that all the other equally important powers are still permanently held by illegitimate careerists. These are archaic tyrannical figures (for they keep the public domain prisoner, never returning it to the People, who have long since become its rightful owners), originating from systems dating back to far pre-democratic eras. These individuals are not our employees at all but genuine public delinquents.

<br><br>

They have always broken the Law, for a commonly owned good cannot be handed over without a pre-established time limit—permanently, that is—to the detriment of contemporary citizens with equal rights to enjoy that good and the requisite professional qualifications.

<br><br>

So let us summarize:

<br><br>

THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC ROLES PERIODICALLY RETURNED TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDES THE PERCENTAGE OF DEMOCRACY ACHIEVED.

<br><br>

THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ROLES PERIODICALLY RETURNED TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDES THE QUALITY OF THE DEMOCRACY ACHIEVED.

<br><br>

Some time ago, a celebrity declared that the essence of democracy lies in nothing more than the ability to change those who govern us. Clearly, they didn’t tell the whole story. They should have said that Democracy consists in the ability to change not only those who govern us but also—and starting with—those who administer us, educate us, inform us, heal us, measure us with statistics, collect our taxes, control us, judge us, repress us, imprison us, urbanize us, and so on and so forth. Had this been said, had even one celebrity taken this small, honest step toward an incontrovertible truth, the world today would be different. Utterly unrecognizable. No new wars could have erupted without the persistence of old states owned by a rotten caste of lifelong appointees, had they been replaced in time with true Republics: temporarily participated in by citizens suited to the role.

<br><br>

Thus: sovereignty is much discussed today, but as happens when notables are given free rein, the more time passes, the more the object of attention dissolves in their ineptitude. We, who are not titled but, as free humans, wish to enjoy it as entitled by Constitution and Democracy, must assert until it becomes crystal clear that sovereignty (an ancient concept yet wholly one with the modern notion of ownership) pertains to all that concerns the Public: everything that belongs to the collective. To the Italian People. Thus, material and immaterial goods, real estate, resources, institutions, decision-making and functional bodies, their powers and resources.

<br><br>

Rephrasing, we can say that sovereignty relates to all that is public in a country: the Res Publica, in Italian, the Republic. Democracy consists precisely in the sharing and participation in the goods and resources over which the People hold Sovereignty—that is, of which they are the Owners. Let us understand and develop these concepts deeply, we simple human beings endowed with comprehension and sensitivity. Let us take the floor ourselves. Let us finally silence that caste of teachers, lecturers, professors—ignoble tamers whose sole purpose, for three-quarters of a century, has been to keep us far from the truth. Far from Democracy. Enough with their indoctrination: now it’s our turn to enlighten them all!

<br><br>

No more of their fixed posts, eternal bastions of career and power. No more excluding us from our own Republic—not just the Italian one, but also the Res Publica of the European Union. The EU will heal itself once its citizens can take charge of it.
Thus: out forever with all the medieval bureaucratic careerists who rob us of the Public Domain, our sacred national co-ownership. Let us immediately liberate, simply by applying the Law (if nothing else, the one governing generic co-ownership), every position and power in the public sphere. Out with them, and in with rigorously temporary, competent, suitable, and prepared citizens, succeeding one another fraternally through the Institute of the Public Employment Bank.

Peacefully, legally, civilly,<br>
let us evolve Italy and the entire Planet.<br>  
The Republic: accessible, participatory,<br>
permeated, osmotic, fluid. Lived.

<br><br>

Long live the <a class="noline" HREF="../ars/en/bank.htm" target="bank">Public Jobs Bank</a>!

And long live Danilo too! The only human in the world who opens the doors of the Republic to his peers, so that suitable individuals may succeed one another, overseeing, improving, and verifying the work of those who came before. Thus preventing any injustice and allowing each person to learn something new every day. Viva Danilo! The only one who guarantees a minimum of power to every human on Earth. He will never sit in a parliament, but the world is changing entirely on its own, doing the work that hordes of esteemed celebrities and respected professionals never deigned to undertake. Viva Danilo! His advanced societal technology (Democracy = co-ownership and sharing of the Res Publica) has no equal in the world. And with it, the world everywhere will never be the same again!
