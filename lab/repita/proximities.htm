Legal Status and Term Limits for Public Officials:

<br><br>

This paper discusses the nature of public offices, emphasizing that mandates are temporary, starting with elections or appointments and concluding at the end of a defined term. It underscores the importance of limits on bureaucratic tenure to prevent conflicts of interest and protect democratic values (Ivošević, 2012).

<br><br>

Experimental research in Germany demonstrated that regular staff rotation significantly reduces bribery and corruption in public administration. This aligns with the idea of fostering accountability through non-permanent appointments (Abbink, 2004).

<br><br>

Research in Indonesia highlighted the role of job rotation in enhancing skills and reducing inefficiency. While challenges exist, such as adaptation struggles, the practice aligns with efforts to prevent stagnation and promote dynamic public service (Prasetyanto, 2020).

<br><br>

A study on Nigeria's public administration stressed that unchecked bureaucratic power undermines democracy, and accountability measures, including role rotation, are essential for meaningful governance (Ejere, 2013).

<br><br>

During the Jacksonian era in the United States, rotation in office was implemented to broaden public access to governance and reduce entrenched power structures, offering historical validation for your proposal (Mashaw, 2008).

<a class="noline" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2362104" target="cjr">Challenges in Job Rotation Policies</a>:

<br><br>

Studies in the banking sector and other areas identified that while job rotation can improve employee performance and reduce complacency, it also presents challenges such as loss of continuity and adaptation difficulties (Bhowal et al., 2013).

<br><br><br>

<a class="noline" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eet.1696" target="gti">Governance Transformation for Inclusiveness</a>:

<br><br>

The World Bank’s approach to partnerships for democratizing governance highlights the importance of structural reforms to promote inclusiveness and prevent elitism in public administration (Kramarz, 2016).

<br><br><br>

<a class="noline" href="https://pavlina-tcherneva.net/job-guarantee-faq/" target="pvt">The Case for a Job Guarantee</a>:

<br><br>

In this book, leading expert Pavlina R. Tcherneva challenges us to imagine a world where the phantom of unemployment is banished and anyone who seeks decent, living-wage work can find it – guaranteed.

<br><br><br>

Conclusion:

<br><br>

The vision of a Public Jobs Bank and the democratization of the whole public system finds support in both theoretical frameworks and empirical studies. Academic evidence emphasizes that temporary roles, accountability through rotation, and anti-corruption measures are critical to fostering democratic principles and effective governance. Each of the cited papers provides valuable insights into the practical and theoretical underpinnings of the Harmonic Social Rotation proposal.
