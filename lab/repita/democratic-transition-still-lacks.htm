DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION<br>IS STILL URGENTLY NEEDED EVERYWHERE!

</font>

<br><br><br>

From East to West, from North to South.

<br><br>

Every regime, every tyranny relies on the life-long hiring of a few (or on mercenaries) within public apparatuses, granting dictators the power to lord at will over the ousted population. Democracy, however, is based—and can only be based—on the active participation of citizens thanks to hiring rigorusly pro tempore. Once this period ends, they return to being ordinary people and equal partners in society.

<br><br>

Demand the <a class="noline" href="index.htm">Public Jobs Bank</a>, and everything will soon fall into place. Why waste time denouncing, complaining, or despairing every day when we can solve all problems once and for all by dismissing the life-long hired people from public jobs and powers? After all, they are called public for a reason!

<br><br>

Let us move from the uncritical and trusty careerist of medieval times to the attentive and thoughtful citizen of modern times. Nothing else is needed to live happily. Because what matters most is not so much who governs but who surrounds those in power!

<br><br>

Democracy is not about voting but about the rigorous temporariness of every public job and assignment. Let us, therefore, free our holy Republic, our beloved country, and our very lives from those who had the effrontery to seize them. Every other country in the world will follow our shining example!

<br><br>

Never again will there be dictatorships, repression, tyrannies. Never again will their victims weigh on our conscience.

Peacefully, legally, and civilly, Italy, Europe and the entire planet will evolve.

<br>

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid, osmotic, participatory, and lived. Serene.

<br><br><br>

Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank!

<br><br>

And hurrah for Danilo, too! The only one who opens the doors of the Republic to citizens, enabling them to take turns, monitor, improve, and verify the work of those who came before them. This prevents injustice and allows everyone to learn and grow every day.

<br><br>

Hurrah for Danilo! The only one who guarantees every human on Earth a minimum share of power. He will never sit in a parliament, yet he is changing the world all by himself! Simply by clarifying, reorganizing, and explaining.

<br><br>

Hurrah for Danilo! The world is beginning to take on brighter colors, and the Earth is finally spinning as it should.

In accordance with the theory of the social patent—which advances humanity just as the industrial patent advanced technology—every Laboratory project comes with a price. If those who make truly advance, evolve the world, Humanity, do not become filthy rich, how can we ever direct Humans towards this sacred holy goal?
