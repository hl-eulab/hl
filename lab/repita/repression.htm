!!! REPRESSION !!!

</font>

<br><br><br>

Many complain about it, many activists all over the world take a lot of blows. Journalists also suffer from it some times. Yet, upon reflection, repression only makes victims among dishonest and inept. In fact it would be enough for those who suffer it to start telling the truth and the repression would disappear in a short time. The solution spreading at the speed of light.

<br><br>

Yup. It is sufficient to replace the word "repression" with the clear formulation: "people life-hired in public jobs" and you understand where the problem is and immediately you will find the solution. All we need is to dismiss every repugnant putrid hired-for-life in jobs that cannot be eternally possessed (otherwise we become tyrants!) but must be regularly returned to the People, to citizens: only in this way, the Democracy and the national co-ownership named Republic exists. Then let us begin hiring strictly pro tempore and everything falls into place. No despotism and dictatorship will have any more way to manifest on Earth.

<br><br>

Life becomes wonderful when we allow it to be simple.

<br><br>

Just be honest and prevent yourself from being stupid and every solution immediately leaps to our eyes. When we see activists and journalists hard hit by the "repression", let us not be sad but exult! In fact only the inept and dishonest people (who deserve the end they make) end up being hit. Nobody of these wretches, in all these decades, have given space, let pass, disclosed and then developed in turn the societary vision that has at its center the Institute of the Public Jobs Bank. Only the absence, in every Country in the world, of this sacred Institution still keeps our lives oppressed by sad and painful political situations.

<br><br>

So to those who are repressed let say without doubt: done right!

<br><br>

The hired-for-life in the still-fake-public jobs, the repressors, must beat you even stronger, imprison you and throw away the key! Who knows that in this way you repressed, you dishonest or inept, or both things put together, you do not decide to realize that to beat you is not a lonely dictator but a canea of mercenaries, of ​​hired-for-life in jobs that instead always must be returned to the People: so that they are made available to suitable and prepared citizens through the Public Jobs Bank which democratically redistributes them pro tempore. Who knows if you may come to understand that the dictator at the top holds himself on the tyrants he has put under him, who uncritically support him because so much they like a permanent job and a power career.

<br><br>

Life becomes wonderful when its simplicity is discovered. But never a dishonest or an inept person has been able to find it. So everyone should pay attention to be truly honest, which is not so easy because, first of all, one should not be inept. Which thing is solved by working long and hard, by studying, researching, knowing that must be sayd "no!" to the first thousand minor ideas that come to mind. Only the one thousand and one being the really good thought, the one that all problems at once resolve.

The Republic: accessible, dynamic,<br>
osmotic, participatory. Lived!

<br><br>

Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank! The sacred Institution that will give to the Earth far more beautiful colors than the present. And hurrah for Danilo too! A coin for the only activist, political, researcher in the world who does not make easy his life by repeating what others repeat without ever interposing their brain. And dig, pick and shovel till to find the brightest diamonds.
