A NEW DNA FOR OUR COUNTRIES AND THE EU

</font>

<br><br><br>

Never as now are spoken long and polished speeches about how to get out of the deep chasm in which we have slipped. But not many elaborate words are needed (unless you want to hide the truth) to describe the monstrous organism that imprisons us and kills our joy of life. It is very simple: associations, cliques, elites, lobbies and mafias elect politicians and direct the governments. So these issue a sea of ​​ad hoc laws, hung on one hand, exasperated, unjust and unjustified, unbalanced, counting on the fact of having a State apparatus remained tyrant (not a Res Publica participated by citizens but a monarchy in the hands of a minority hired for life in the public employments, of a casta of bureaucrats, of an aristocracy of careerists) to apply, weapons in hand, without reasons, the boorish laws written on commission.

<br><br>

That's all! Let us ignore the economists, philosophers, intellectuals, the great, illustrious, magnificent thinkers ... because they are all taken children, tamed and deeply inculcated by the public careerists and for this reason they are much more than useless: harmful. In fact, the world has only one chance to evolve.

<br><br>

Let us dismiss every hired for life in the public sector, every bureaucrat, every public careerist, let us alternate we citizens (suitably competent and prepared) in our Res Publica, in every holy job / power of the State. Dismissed the uncritical servants, loyal to the fixed job and with craving for career and power, everything will heal automatically even before of when we expect. Because by having around human beings, individuals, people in their original, free and pure state, no longer many small and great priebke willing to do anything but many attentive and caring snowden, the governments will take care to do exactly what is necessary: ​​write few balanced and universal, reasonable and rational rules, to be constantly refined and never questioned again.

<br><br>

Life can be wonderful or the opposite. Everything works in how we prepare it. Let us look online for the PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT BANK and, if we yet don't find it, let's build it immediately! Because it is from the nucleus that the social cell is redrawn and revived. And by building real Res Publica, by erecting really democratic States, we will have laid the foundations for a democratic EU too: open, shared, dynamic, fluid, osmotic, participatory. Lived by free and pure human beings.

<br><br>

Well: don't you like these ideas?

<br><br>

Ok, you will get populisms! populisms! populisms! Nothing more than POPULISMS. And goodbye to the EU.
