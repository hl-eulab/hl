THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAR ...

</font>

<br><br><br>

This is yet another war made by the lifelong hired in jobs that have never been made public: accessible strictly pro tempore, so as to allow a healthy regular renewal of the personnel and that fundamental broad participation on which Democracy is based and without which there is tyranny and nothing else. This is yet another war by ugly people who are very loyal to their permanent job and to this very obedient, who for this pathological dependence uncritically support every worst tyrant and dictator. This is the umpteenth war by filthy criminals who, treacherously seizing the Res Publica, use it to transmit the information and news that the maximum tyrant wants and, due to a consensus built on deception, lies, omissions, he will be able to do secure, undisturbed the worst he will want. This is the umpteenth war by wretched thieves of the Public Good who for three quarters of a century have been deceiving, betraying, cheating us, passing off as "democracy" their tyranny, their monarchy for "republic". It is precisely these people, true felons, who prevented the advancement of our Countries, when it would have been so easy to evolve us first so that other Countries could then too. Today we would not find ourselves in these situations if the unduly permast monarchical state owned by them had been replaced at the time by a real Republic belonging to and participated by the People.

<br><br>

However, we have taken at least one step forward. No filthy hired for life in jobs owned by the Sovereign People will no longer be able to deceive us. Now we know how it works. We know that it is below that we must look, at their level, and not upwards, where the means of mass communication direct us, disorienting us. To the brave humans we say: do not arm even more an already ferocious war, do not go to fight. If it is on the field that humans destroy themselves, it is in front of a desk that a new world is being built. Isn't three quarters of a century thrown away enough for you?
