DEMOCRACY and REPUBLIC: What They Really Are

</font>

<br><br><br>

Democracy is a societal organization where the People rise as Sovereign and establish a Republic: a vast national co-ownership composed of codes, entities and institutions, assets, properties and resources, employment positions, powers and incomes to be cared for collectively and enjoyed equally. This can happen simultaneously, when that specific part of the res publica allows (as in the case of a public garden), or by succeeding one another pro tempore (as required in public employment, power, or role) to ensure that ownership of the asset remains with the People.

<br><br>

Thus it is!

<br><br>

Democracy is the exact opposite of tyranny: empires, monarchies, principalities, or the like. In tyranny, the People remain subjugated by those who permanently hold central power, excluding others. In Democracy, however, citizens can access their Res Publica through a specific Institution that periodically redistributes it, starting with public jobs. In this way, everyone can engage in active public life and contribute to shaping their own destiny, while society benefits from a broad perspective, enriched by the contributions of all, enabling it to overcome every obstacle unscathed.

<br><br>

In summary: A real Democracy and a true Republic can only exist if the People have access to an institution like a Public Jobs Bank, ensuring the regular renewal of those who manage, utilize, and benefit from the res publica.

<br><br>

Now consider this: how many professors and professionals, philosophers and writers, experts and scientists, politicians and rulers, heroes and saints, receive our continuous attention and esteem? Countless. And on what basis have we granted them this? How can we place our trust in people who evidently don’t even know the most basic principles of collective life? Especially when the indispensable, clear, simple, and irrefutable definition of Democracy and Republic (which fully explains and resolves the current national, continental, and global aberration) is now offered by an obscure nobody like the undersigned, while it has never been articulated by our so celebrated figures?

Humanity: for a long time, you’ve played games, joked, laughed, and wasted time. You’ve suffered as well, but never confronting problems with clean, clear eyes. It’s time to reassess the value we assign to ideas and people. As we are now on Earth, relying on individuals who neither possess the necessary fundamentals nor intend to acquire them, nobody has hope of securing a future. Become aware: either evolve quickly or vanish.

In line with the theory of the <a class="noline" HREF="../mercato/index.htm" target="rights">Social Patent</a> (which advances Humanity just as the industrial patent has done for technology), every discovery, project, or vision of the Laboratory comes with a cost/price. Discover now the <a class="noline" HREF="../mercato/index.htm" target="rights">Social Innovation Market</a>. If one cannot enrich oneself by making discoveries in the humanistic field ... when will Humanity ever progress and abandon its vast ignorance in this domain?! When Mankind will be at the same level of the technological one?
