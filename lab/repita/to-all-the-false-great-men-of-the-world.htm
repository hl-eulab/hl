TO ALL<br>THE FALSE GREAT MEN<br>OF THE WORLD<br>AND THEIR FANATICS!

</font>

<br><br><br>

Every day a quote, a famous maxim, a superfine thought appears. Every day someone celebrates and regrets an intellectual, a great sage, a heroic revolutionary, a holy man ... but go all to lick WCs! None of all the highly celebrated "great men" that this poor Planet has had to put up with has ever understood, let alone reported, that the abominable system that has always afflicted the world everywhere (the evil tyranny, the tragic dictatorship) is based on nothing other than the exclusion of the citizens (people who own the res publica and there must succeed pro tempore one another) from the centrality of jobs/powers/roles. Still assigned instead with engagements without pre-set time limits to a caste and mafia of abject prevaricating individuals!

<br><br>

Let's see, among modest people, without fanfare behind them, how things work. It's all very simple.

<br><br>

Associations, cliques, elites, groups, lobbies, orders and various mafias amass foolish and corrupt people and elect rulers. These hire, without a pre-determined time limit (therefore in a still fake-public job) a minority, building their loyalty with a permanent job and the promise of growing career and power. They make them a caste with which they can dominate the greater part of the population, which is in fact marginalized, rendered impotent, and in this way they realize undisturbed the wishes of the aforementioned associations, cliques, elites, groups, lobbies, orders and mafias.

<br><br>

The entire terrifying system that has semi-destroyed the world and is ending up reducing it to rubble is based on the undue perennial holders (bureaucrats, immovable careerists) of a job that never could become public, participated. But as soon as we citizens chase them away and begin to follow one another (suitable, competent and opportunely prepared) in all the sacred jobs of our Republic, the rulers will have to start doing what is really needed and no longer what associations, cliques want , elites, groups, lobbies, orders and various mafias want.

<br><br>

It's about bringing centrality from cowardly priebke-style conduct to courageous snowden-style approach. It is urgent to evolve: forget politics. Because all this revolution can do without it while remaining completely peaceful. It is sufficient to apply what must be considered the first law of the Republic: accepting and granting without a fixed time limit a common property (such as a public employment, power, income) is illegal because it constitutes a definitive loss for coeval citizens/co-owners and the res publica is effectively reduced to a good private of access to others.

<br><br>

Let us set aside those who take turns in the parliaments. The politicians: let us surprise them all! Instead of losing ourselves in advocating everyone on Earth for (or going against) this (or that other) policy, let's aim straight at the centrality of public jobs and conquer it by democratizing it. Let's make it a real Republic. Let's introduce the founding principle of Democracy: the rigorously fixed-term assignment of every public job, power, income. The submerged iceberg made up of perennial tyrants (the deep state) will immediately melt under the light of our sparkling eyes and there will no longer be any ruler who will fail to fulfill his duties.

<br><br>

Let us demand today the Public Jobs Bank: without even toiling, we will defeat forever every association, clique, elite, group, lobby, order and mafia that has afflicted the Earth. The fine human sensibilities of the individual will triumph over the crude dehumanized notions of the driven masses. A real Democracy will be established and the rulers will have to re-meditate what to do in the light of the many new ideas they will receive continuously.

<br><br>

And now we close by addressing again a thought (not at all grateful) to all those philosophers, intellectuals, thinkers, revolutionaries (deceased or still present) who have never bothered, in such a long time, to tell us the above. Goodbye, great cheaters! You have tricked entire generations of poor Humans in search of the most pregnant truth that they certainly never could receive from you! On Earth we have wasted so much time in vain, reading your acclaimed writings ... that now we can happily throw them away, with superhuman joy, cramming them all together in a big recycling box! Finally you will become useful!

<br><br>

Celebrities! Don't you show up anymore. Once one human has understood you, with each sunrise it will become more and more clear to anyone how disproportionate is that too much you have received compared to that nothing you have given.

Every law firm in the world has lost human trust<br>
never denouncing the illegality of the assignment for life<br>
of public jobs, powers and incomes: common goods.

<br><br>

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid,<br>
osmotic, participated, lived. Serene.
