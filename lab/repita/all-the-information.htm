All the information of the world ...

</font>

<br><br><br>

All the information of the world is not worth the awareness that there is no Democracy in Countries where the Res Publica (specifically: public jobs, powers, incomes) are given for life to some hugly people who just so become a casta (a camarilla of true criminals, thieves of our common good, of our national coownership, of our Res Publica) that acritically obey to every worst law signed by governments piloted by elites and mafias. Many are in prison (and all the world remains prisoner too) only because no celebrity, journalist, philosopher, professor, in so many decennials, denounced the unduly remained monarchy of the bad guys hired-for-life in the never-been-public jobs.

<br><br>

No celebrity, journalist, philosopher, professor told us that Democracy requires the sharing of the Res Publica through the fundamental rule of the pro tempore. This is the main cause that keeps so many people unjustly in prison and the whole world prisoner of every kind of wickedness and subdued too. And it makes not honor to ask for the release of someone, of one human, and not that of the whole world. No, unfortunately any journalist's freedom is not our freedom. Only if we work for an aim that solves the problem of all our world, we can say: our engagement is really important for the future of everyone, of all the journalists in danger, of all people on Earth. Yes.

Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank!

<br><br>

And hurrah for Danilo too! The only human who opens to citizens the doors of their Republic: so that they can succeed one another and control, improve, verify the work of those who preceded them. Thus preventing any injustice and being able to learn each day something more. Hurrah for Danilo! The only who guarantees a minimum power to every human on Earth. He will never sit in a parliament but the whole world is changing all by himself! By doing the job that no celebrity or professional ever deigned to do. Hurrah for Danilo! And the Earth finally begins turning as it should.
