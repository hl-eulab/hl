THE PERVERSE ROLE OF JOURNALISTS

</font>

<br><br><br>

Until a few decades ago, Humanity had begun to evolve and progress at a good pace, with positive results already emerging. Then, journalists multiplied, springing up everywhere in droves. They started pouring immense amounts of sterile, daily chronicles onto unprepared human beings—at first paralyzing them and now almost entirely suppressing our evolutionary process. If we look around today, we see nothing but a vain, repetitive everyday life. Journalists have, in fact, killed our bright future by perpetuating the filthy present, a reality incapable of change because it is firmly anchored to itself by journalists. It is therefore essential to remember that nothing holds absolute value.

<br><br>

Least of all does information have value when it never moves beyond a mere account of existing situations (which we already know in depth) and blocks the path to broad and courageous transformative visions. Foremost among these is the Democratic Transition—the periodic return to the People of those sacred, inalienable common properties: public jobs, powers, and incomes. And yet, this concept remains entirely absent from the flood of information that dominates us. Even though we are small in the face of such global phenomena, let us commit to understanding how things truly stand. Knowledge is already power, because everything always begins there. Information must no longer act as a screen preventing access to the broader knowledge that Humanity has always needed.

Hurrah for the Public Jobs Bank!

<br><br>

And hurrah for Danilo too! The only human in the world who opens the doors of the Republic to its citizens—so that they may succeed one another, competent and prepared, verifying, improving, and overseeing the work of their predecessors. Thus preventing injustice and ensuring that everyone learns something more every day.

<br><br>

Hurrah for Danilo! The only one who guarantees a minimum share of power to every human on Earth. He will never sit in a parliament, yet he is changing the whole world by himself! Doing the work that no celebrity, leader, or myth—nor any association, institution, or organization—has ever dared to do.

<br><br>

Hurrah for Danilo! And the Earth begins to turn as it must.

In accordance with the theory of the social patent (which advances humanity just as industrial patents advanced technology), each Laboratory project has a price. More information is available on its Internet domain: http://market.hyperlinker.org If those who truly help Humanity advance—not merely through small, useless adjustments but by providing real evolutionary fuel—do not become immensely wealthy like other great humans, how will Humanity ever pull itself out of its swamps?
