A FATAL SILENCE

</font>

<br><br><br>

Occasionally someone remembers people who have given so much to the world and that for their work have been on the contrary persecuted. Thus many appeals are renewed in favor of Assange, Snowden and others. Trouble is that these appeals, in the face of the proven intelligence of those who would like to help, are totally devoid of this wonderful quality of the human being. Yes, because, if you want to make free Assange, Snowden and all those who denounce the misdeeds of the States, the only collective action to be advocated is to require the dismissal of all the state officials, the public careerists, the bureaucrats, of all every hired for life in the State, in the "public" employment.

<br><br>

Tragic truth is that our "modern" States are not democratic: they still do not have their powers, their roles, their public employments periodically returned to Peoples despite they want themselves Sovereigns. All our States are still a property of the public careerists, of the bureaucrats, of the hired for life in the fake-public, literally a Their Thing. Not a Res Publica but rather real monarchies that perpetuated themselves due to the fatal silence of peoples who, although forced, submissive and oppressed all the time, were unable to find a rag of philosopher that awakened them by saying to them: let's fire all the public careerists! let's fire, let's dismiss them now!

<br><br>

For the good of all, even more for people like Assange, let us make democratic the States, starting from our own. Let us make them accessible, as Democracy requires, to the fixed-term participation of citizens who have all the requirements necessary for the role. Surely there will be no more need to report any illegal behavior: because there will be no more. There will be no longer attachment to the fixed job and desire for career/power to silence consciences, to allow misdeeds and to drive events.

<br><br>

Let us all stand up and claim open, dynamic, fluid, osmotic, participatory, lived States: free from tyrants, whose employments/powers/incomes are granted strictly for a fixed term. Let's stop focusing on politics, blaming the governments. They, without the public careerists but with naked and pure human beings around them, would behave correctly. So let's focus on the public careerists and let's fire them all. We claim our Res Publica back, bearing in mind that periodically firing those who hold a public role is a pacifist practice par excellence: because it avoids irregular but predictable bloody revolutions.

With all these dissident intellectuals, with all these think tanks, some might say so.

Public jobs/powers are democratic<br>
only if granted strictly temporarily!
