A SERIOUS QUESTION OF ILLEGALITY

</font>

<br><br><br>

The lifelong assignment, without any time limit, of a common property asset to an individual prevents other co-owners from benefiting from it and nullifies its very status as shared property. It reduces it to the mere dominion of a few, denying access to others. Such a transfer cannot be carried out without first adequately informing all those entitled to the asset of the serious loss they will incur.

<br><br>

In the absence of such fulfillment, the act can be considered null and void.

<br><br>

1st Question: Why have Italian and European citizens never been informed of their rights to that fundamental collective asset, the res publica, an essential part of which consists of public employment, powers, and incomes, and of the consequences of their lifelong transfer, which represents a definitive loss for them?

<br><br>

2nd Question: Given the failure to inform citizens about the nature, function, and legal status of the centrality of the Republic as a common asset, and thus the very foundation of participatory Democracy, how can the act of lifelong assignment of public employment be valid?!

<br><br>

3rd Question: If what has been stated is true (and it is hard to see how it could not be), considering that those who failed to fulfill their duties were precisely those charged with applying and enforcing the Law, and considering that by not complying, they took permanent possession of the national collective property, the res publica, monopolizing it and depriving the population of a legitimate and primary right to enjoy this asset, can their actions be regarded as a real criminal act to be prosecuted under the very Law they failed to apply? If they indeed acted not in the public interest but for personal gain, could they be held personally responsible for the damage suffered by individuals and society as a result of the non-application of those clear and defined rules which, if respected, would have allowed the country to evolve smoothly over the past decades?

<br><br>

Not to mention the great progress the entire world would have made, benefiting from such an example.

<br><br>

Since magistrates, university professors, constitutionalists, and all the other current major owners of the unlawfully preserved monarchical state (because this is what they have kept in place, ensuring that centrality continues to be ceded without a predetermined time limit, as in the times of the duke and the king, excluding the participation of many with equal rights, qualifications, and professional skills) are brazen medieval careerists whom governments have always looked up to and even submitted to (with all of us being taken as children and domesticated, trained, and inculcated according to their dictates), so heavily suspected of the worst crimes humans can commit: deception, betrayal, and continuous fraud against the Country and the People, aggravated theft repeatedly perpetrated against the sacred common property, what are we waiting for to bring the issue to public attention, to free the sacred Institutions of the Republic and finally equip them with staff loyal to democratic and republican principles, conscious and prepared, something entirely different from what currently exists?

<br><br>

This is not an egalitarian or political issue. It is the Law itself that has been and continues to be violated and outraged by them.

<br><br>

Italy is our country; the Italian Republic is the extraordinary national co-ownership that makes us citizens equal partners in caring for it and equal beneficiaries of its wealth. After three-quarters of a century of illegality, Italy must regularize itself. And those who erred must pay. From a caste of self-proclaimed superior beings, let it be written that, in reality, theirs is a caste of beings to be regarded as globally and universally inferior. Maximum respect for every Public Official, civil and military, of the Republic!!! Precisely for this reason, those who have appropriated these sacred roles must immediately return them to the Sovereign People.

<br><br>

And so we may finally understand what Democracy truly is.

of the Eudaemony Laboratory

<br><br>

In accordance with the theory of the social patent (which advances Humanity just as the industrial patent advanced technology), every project of the Laboratory deserves a reward. Information available on its Internet domain.

<br><br>

Every law firm in the world can regain trust<br>
by becoming an unceasing advocate<br>
against the illegal lifelong transfer<br>
of public employment, powers, incomes,<br>
sacred assets of common ownership.

<br><br>

The Republic: accessible, dynamic, fluid,<br>
osmotic, participatory, experienced. Se-re-ne!

<br><br>

Long live the Public Jobs Bank! Because it does not matter so much who governs as who surrounds those who govern.

<br><br>

And long live Danilo! The only human in the world who opened the doors of the Republic to his peers: so that they may succeed one another, verify, control, and improve the work of those who preceded them. Preventing injustices and enabling everyone to improve daily by learning more. Honor to Danilo! The only one who guarantees a minimum power to every human on Earth. He will never sit in a parliament, but the whole world is already changing by itself. Doing the work that no prominent celebrity or esteemed professional ever deigned to do. Hurrah for Danilo! And the Earth finally spins as it should. Life takes on far better colors than the bleak ones of today. Thanks to his theory of the social patent, every project, discovery, or innovation that benefits a People also rewards its author. In a continuous, uninterrupted triumph of evolution.
