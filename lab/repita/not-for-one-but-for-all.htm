If all the people, worrying for a human alone, would have engaged themselves in saving Mankind, in liberating all humans from the tyranny of those who are hired-for-life in jobs that should be public, participated only pro tempore, today we would have no injustices, no death, no destructions. Your same hero has been lead in prison by eternal state-careerists, not by polliticians. You are not awake. You are sleeping. Doesn't matter so much a human alone but all humans! No one can save himself by alone. We all are joint by a unique fate on this Planet. Every one of us, on Earth, has therefore the specific duty to affirm this principle: doesn't matter so much who governs but those who are around who governs! Let us all call for Bank of Public Jobs in our respective Country. We will had laid the groundwork for a serene future for everyone. Wake up, people! Not for one, but for all.
