YOUNGS, NEW BARBARIANS: REFINE YOURSELF!

</font>

<br><br><br>

To the young ladies and gentlemen who parade "in defense of the environment": do not show beyond your total ignorance of the facts of life. If you really love nature, why do you go out on the street? First of all, blame your own parents: they gave you birth. It has been known for a long time, for over a century, that the population hyper-growth, so rapid as to evoke an explosion that certainly could not be appreciated by the rest of the biosphere, would have caused everything that is precisely happening today. Exactly as expected. Each new born has been added to the other humans as if he were another dry log of wood placed on the great fire of an already incandescent, exasperated, violent economy, because produced by human aggregates devoids that saving flywheel of jobs, incomes, resources, essential part of every Res Publica, which only would have ensured guarantees and serenity to everyone.

<br><br>

If by losing your job you cannot find another one, you become willing to do anything, any worst practice, just to keep it. You also agree to build mines anti-personnel, anti-women, anti-children, even when there is no reason to wage war. But if the Public Employment Bank had been established in time, as requested by Democracy, which is implemented by sharing the whole Res Publica, everyone would have been able to live industriously but also quietly, thanks to a public guarantee of income. And the private economy would not have become so paroxysmal and superficial.

<br><br>

But say, ignorant and know-it-all youngsters: why do you turn to politicians to save the natural environment? Doesn't it occur to you that those who caused the problem will never be able to solve it?! You do not realize that you are (as happens to young people of all historical periods) domesticated, inculcated and projected in directions that are convenient for the powerful alone, today in particular those who, in the dark, never being in the spotlight, command the world?

<br><br>

Say, young barbarians, do you want other submissive and oppressive laws? Do you want to end up like those poor parents you had, who never told you just one right? They too were taken when little, like you, tamed to ignorance, inculcated with doctrines and superstitions, rendered completely incapable of understanding so as to want at any cost, strongly, exactly what the powerful had ordered. Young uneducated people, know this, at least you, today, who have all kinds of means of intellectual development. There is only one thing to do to solve everything well: to dismiss any shameless hired for life in the hitherto never-been-public jobs, which took, and still maintain, the overthrown monarchical state and prevented the rise of our Republics.

<br><br>

They were, the public delinquents: guilty of continued abuse of power, of reiterated theft of the Public Thing, betrayal of the Sovereign People, fraudsters of every human being, who have not only hidden the illegitimacy of the definitive transfer (for contemporary citizens) of the sacred Common Good, but also destroyed nature, landscape and territory, directly and indirectly, allowing all this to be devoured even by ultra-hungry private individuals.

<br><br>

They are precisely these unfortunates (illegitimate monarchs of the scientific, statistical, educational, informational, administrative, judicial power, shamelessly passed off as "public") who have prevented the rising of a DEMOGRAPHIC CONSCIENCE that be also broad and profound on the whole: that it was capable of understanding the new times to the point of helping everyone to manage well themselves. Let us therefore chase them all away, finally applying we the Law to them. Let's immediately open the Public Employment Bank and take turns strictly pro tempore (suitably fit for the role) in their place. Only in this way every human being in the world can grow, evolve, mature. We will no longer be forced to live as specialized animals but we will be able to change jobs and lives more than once and broaden our vision.

<br><br>

All life-hired people in the Republics of every Country in the world be out forever! Only in this way (by having around no more uncritical priebke but preparad snowden) the politicians will no longer be able to fulfill the wishes of the powerful. Instead, as inmates finally freed from unjust imprisonment, capable and superfine Good Rulers will appear.

<br><br>

Young people! Help build a world that is no longer based on strength but on Knowledge and Reason!
