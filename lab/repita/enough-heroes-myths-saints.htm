ENOUGH WITH HEROES, MYTHS, SAINTS!

</font>

<br><br><br>

It's ridiculous that a man can be so much mythologized even today that every one on Earth should have outdated every archaic/superstitious thinking model. But it seems that many people are so little evolved still to keep an umpteenth holy card or wear yet another t-shirt with the face of someone who is in media fashion not withstanding he does not change anything in the organization of our Countries and Societies. No, any human is not so important to absorb the attentions of Mankind. This is yet another screen that hides a broad truth that no one wants to see because it involves much more effort to understand than showing a holy card. By now an Imminent Almost Total Extinction threatens the most of us and whoever wants to live must put aside every hero, myth and saint and get busy to overthrow the tyranny of the global caste and mafia of the bureaucrats who constitute the so-called deep-state. Public Jobs Bank! Perennials careerists hired-for-life are expelled and citizens begin alternate themselves thanks to the fundamental rule of pro tempore. This preciseply is Democracy: the sharing of our Res Publica. Just in this way we all become free and masters of our destiny. Tell that to your hero, myth, saint: don't claim to be saved only you. All Mankind must be freed from the thieving tyrants of the Res Publica.
