For a global system of proposition,<br>confrontation and deliberation

<div align="justify">

The procedure of proposition, confrontation and deliberation, like introduced in this <a class="underline" href="example.htm">example</a> currently lacking in functionality, can be used both in <b>local</b> way, with a participation narrowed to a specific group of persons, for requirements inner to the association, and in <b>global</b> way, with a participation potentially extended to the peoples of the whole planet, when we would confront ourselves on issues equally extended.

<br><br>

The same applications, the same softwares, that we will use in order to approach all that, will have therefore to be conceived in order to work both in local that global modality. In this second way they need of a wide, complex system able to carry out functions both like a planetary <b>registry</b> for every terrestrial (or extra-terrestrial our host :) that would participate to the discussions, and like an office of the <b>protocol</b> for every motion that be presented.

<br><br>

Please, be aware that here we do not wish a government capillary extended to every single member of the society. The entire social body, today around to seven billions of units, is a matter too much heavy in order to think to can attribute it powers of decision. Notwithstanding, a system potentially able to make confront the whole population of a planet on issues introduced by it itself, the idea of having the possibility of a direct dialogue, without any bureaucratic impediment, any apical difficulty or tightening, is a thing too much beautiful, too much fascinating, an objective too much important in order not to run toward it with enthusiasm.

<br><br>

<b>A global system of proposition, confrontation and deliberation would be another opportunity, focused, direct and immediate, that the humanity would have to understand itself and the reality that it lives. A true planetary agorà at disposition of everyone.</b>

<br><br>

Naturally a system of this kind can induce various fears. It would report in fact the essence of the thought of the persons. And a bad government would certainly be interested in morbose way. Indeed we are already all filed, nobody escapes more to the attention of a continuous, heavy and total surveying. The only possibility that we have with regard to this is to try to behave ourselves always well, and hope that all goes for the best ...

<br><br>

And there is also to consider the fact that the governments are already beginning to supply a system of electronic ballot, that however does not contemplate the possibility of confrontation among those who vote. It is up to us therefore, to free spirits, to indomite beings like us, to offer such valid alternatives to make disappear every other possibility of minor value.
