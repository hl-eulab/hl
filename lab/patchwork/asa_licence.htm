### 1. Declaration of Cession and Cause of Value

<br><br>

The purchase of this Digital Asset is a commemoration of Humanity’s failure to grasp, over such a long period, an opportunity for improved global coexistence.

<br><br>

This Digital Asset has been minted in a strictly limited edition of four specimens (4x) to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its conception.

<br><br>

The Buyer obtains the token (the ASA) and the Blockchain Proof of Authenticity, and nothing further.

<br><br><br>

### 2. Rights CEDED to the Buyer (Unconditional Token Ownership)

<br><br>

By purchasing this ASA, the Buyer exclusively obtains:

<br><br>

Full Token Ownership (ASA): The unconditional, irrevocable, and uncensorable control of the ASA unit within their Algorand wallet.

<br><br>

Right of Disposal: The absolute right to hold, transfer, resell, and list the ASA on any marketplace or platform autonomously.

<br><br>

Collector's Value: The status as the holder of one of the four unique specimens of this Foundational Edition, along with its inherent speculative and collectible value.

<br><br>

Permanent Access: Perpetual access to the proof that the token is immutably linked to the Arweave URL containing the original Patchwork Model homepage.

<br><br><br>

### 3. Rights NOT CEDED and Retained by the Creator

<br><br>

The purchase of this ASA does not, in any way, imply the cession of any intellectual property rights, commercial use rights, or any other form of license regarding the linked content.

<br><br>

Specifically, the Creator (Danilo D'Antonio, Laboratorio Eudemonia) retains the exclusive, total, and perpetual rights to:

<br><br><br>

### 4. Guarantee of Single Edition and Irrepeatability

<br><br>

The Creator guarantees that Asset ASA No. 3280039905 (TPM56), linked to The Patchwork Model homepage, is minted in one and only one edition, limited to four specimens (4x).

<br><br>

No other ASA will ever be minted or issued on the homepage of this subject. This edition is unique and definitive for this specific content and for this specific resolution.

<br><br>

In Summary: The Buyer purchases Authenticity, not Authorship.
