Example of a map that<br>shows the votes of the members of a group<br>
for as regards a unique, specific motion:

<br><br><br>

<font size="4" color="green">FOR A DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT</font>

<br>

<img src="patchwork_en_1.gif" border="0">

<div align="justify">

<br><br>

The confrontation that happens inside a group can be showed both reporting the whole of different proposals under consideration, like in this <a class="underline" href="example.htm">example</a>, and reporting only one motion. In this case the various positions expressed can be reported in the table even in a more collected way. In a little portion of screen we can observe the complete decisional situation of an even numerous group. And in fact the thought of well 300 persons is here showed as much synthetically as efficaciously. The graphical resultance calls even more to our mind a <i>patchwork</i>, the classic work of sewing made with little pieces of woven of various colours.

Like we have previously seen, an importante aspect of this model is the high degree of interactivity of its table: by moving the mouse over every little square we can fastly know the name, we can see the face of the voter, the date of the vote and other essential elements. By clicking over, we can go instead directly to the page where an individual expresses and explains his vote. For example we will arrive to a page like <a class="underline" href="cdd_a_r.htm">this</a>. And there, the promoters of the motion, or people assigned to the conflicts resolution, or any other people wish, can constructively interact with that person.

<br><br>

We should consider that every member of the group, by seeing himself strictly inserted in the whole containing all other his colleagues, will be lead to confront himself and to participate more actively to the votation than in other situations. At the end of the work of group, at the end of the exchange of information and considerations, could happen that a multicolor surface expressing discordant views, could transform in a surface of a sole colour expressing a concord opinion.

<br><br>

The original patchwork, made through little pieces of woven, has always been a humble but fruitful work: by joining together pieces otherwise unuseful we obtain something that can make a function, something integral, something useful. <i>Digital patchworking</i> is a humble activity too, because it can proceed a little piece at once. It will be even more gratifying: persons besides to be unite, joined, close the one to the other, can see little by little their whole to transform itself from a chaotic, discordant, unuseful grouping in a coherent, compact, concord powerful group of social action.

<br><br>

And so we resume:

<br><br>

<font color="green"><i>patchwork</i></font> can be named the interaction model among proposal/s and voters like the above example;

<br><br>

<font color="green"><i>patchworking</i></font> is the work made inside the future digital environments of this kind;

<br><br>

<font color="green"><i>patchworkers</i></font> are the individuals who actively weave and curate the single elements of the debate, transforming discord into refined consensus.
