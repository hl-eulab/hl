Dear <b>Optimism Collective Team</b>,

I'm writing to share a governance model that seems purpose-built for what you're pioneering with the Citizen House—though I conceived it two decades before DAOs existed.


<b>Why Optimism</b>:

Your two-house system—Token House for resources, Citizen House for values—recognizes something crucial: governance isn't just about capital allocation, it's about collective sense-making and genuine deliberation. This is rare wisdom in the crypto space.

The Patchwork Model addresses exactly this: how do distributed communities move from scattered opinions to coherent collective understanding?


<b>The Core Concept</b>:

Imagine governance as a living, visual patchwork where:

   - Every citizen appears as a colored square (green=support, red=oppose, yellow=abstain, white=considering)
    
   - Click any square to understand that person's reasoning and engage in dialogue
    
   - Watch the community's collective mind emerge as discussions transform the pattern from chaos to harmony
    
   - Decisions arise not from vote-counting but from genuine convergence

This isn't voting. It's visual deliberation.


<b>Why This Matters for Citizen House</b>:

Your retroactive public goods funding already shows you understand that governance is about more than plutocracy. The Patchwork Model could be the missing layer that:

   - Makes deliberation visible - see the community's thinking in real-time
    
   - Encourages genuine dialogue - every position invites conversation, not just counting
    
   - Builds stronger legitimacy - decisions emerge from understanding, not bare majorities
    
   - Complements your impact evaluation - combine quantitative metrics with qualitative consensus


<b>The Story</b>:

I conceived this in 2005 for mailing lists and social movements. The problem was clear even then: we had tools for discussion (forums, email) but lacked tools for collective decision-making that preserves nuance.

I wrote: "The lack is significant, because we often risk remaining in pure reflection or simple information, being forced at the crucial moment to renounce that step: a clearly, sharply, publicly expressed position that allows us to advance toward the realization of our ideals."

Twenty years later, you're building the infrastructure for those ideals. Perhaps the timing is finally right.


<b>About Me</b>:

I'm 72 years old. I programmed DEC PDP-8e computers in assembly language 50 years ago. As soon as I had access to the Internet, I began an in-depth sociopolitical analysis and conceived several projects. I propose you one of them.

The Patchwork Model has waited two decades. Optimism's vision of regenerative economics and values-based governance suggests you might be the right community to finally bring it to life.


<b>Documentation</b>:

A simple image there shows the essence of the model.


<b>What I'm Proposing</b>:

I'd welcome the opportunity to:

   - Present the model to your governance team or Citizen House
   - Discuss pilot implementation for specific governance processes
   - Collaborate on adapting TPM to Optimism's unique bicameral structure
   - Explore integration possibilities

I'm not a venture capitalist or a corporate entity. I'm someone who has been thinking about collective intelligence since before it had a name. If Optimism is serious about governance innovation beyond token-weighted voting, I believe we should talk.

Would you be open to a conversation?


With respect and hope,

Some notes about me: <a href="../../index.htm" target="dds">http://dda.hyperlinker.org</a>

P.S. - Your motto "Impact = Profit" resonates deeply. I've worked for the excluded and the planet for 40 years with no compass for money or success. Perhaps that's why these tools remained unbuilt—until communities like yours emerged.
