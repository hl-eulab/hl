--------------------------------------------
For a confrontation and deliberation desktop
A new tool for associations, groups and simple mailing lists
------------------------------------------------------------



Kind Madame/Sir of DYNE.org, please, imagine a special software that let
the single members of a mailing list to take position respect to a motion,
a petition, or any other proposal of social order.


Imagine a special web page containing a table: on a side there is the list
of the proposals, of the decisions to be taken, of the calls, perorations,
etc. but also special sections containing generic themes to be
enlightened. On the perpendicular side there are the members of the
mailing list who are available to publicly express their preferences, by
voting the arguments in discussion.


Therefore, something like this:

           | Vincent |   Anna   | Sandra |   Dan   | etc. etc. etc.

fuels
rationing  |    no   |    yes   |   yes  |   yes   |

public
employment
rotation   |   yes   |     no   |   yes  |   yes   |

optimal
demographic
density    |   yes   |     no   |   yes  |   yes   |

------------- ---------- ----------- -------- --------

responsible
turism     |     ?   |     ok   |    ok  |    ko   |


Naturally for every issue, call, theme, etc. there is a link that sends
back to the document produced by the person or the group (but also by a
delegated commission) in order to expose the matter. And also every member
has a link to a document that let us know who is the person that has
expressed that preference, and the same for every single decision or
opinion, in a way that we can know the reasons, the objections, the doubts
or points remained unresolved.

Through a page of this kind we obtain a general view immediately visible
with only one simple glance. The decisional geography of a group appears
immediately in all its extension. And we find a richness of shadings that
only the contribution of every single person, of every individual
sensibility and knowledge, can add to the proposed issue.

The very important thing, however, is the fact that this table must not be
conceived like something inanimated, static, dead. On the contrary: we
must see it like something dynamic, in continuous evolution, well alive,
quite a pleasant meeting place to be attended even daily, like a club, but
also and mainly a kind of desktop, of table for common work, a situation
for confrontation in which, in basis to the decisions and contributions of
everyone, everyone could also change his/her own decisions.

Periodically those conclusions that would reach the general agreement
would be published with prominence informing other groups, the media, etc.
Those issues that would meet yet disagreement should instead wait that
further reflections and contributions lead to the result of a commonly
felt thought.

Really, to a tool like this is easy add (at least through the imagination
:) a long serie of complements. For example the possibility to order in
different ways the whole table (to be realized probably with the technique
of the database shared on line), and naturally various statistics.

Imagination however leads us to think that, in the case this dynamic and
permanent desktop for confrontation and deliberation would effectively
result useful and it's use would spread around, we could progressively
conceive analogous cybernetic meeting places where collect at an higher
level total data of several groups. In this hypothesis some form of
standardization would be very useful, in a way to permit in short time,
through appropriate digital spiders, the extrapolation of a complete
national feeling in relation to any issue.

The final result of all these possibilities could be a real tool of
evolute democracy, participated electronically. Something well far from
what is waiting for us next (to affix an "x" on an electoral card).

Well: could we cooperate to carry out this crumb of future?

Our best greetings,

Danilo D'Antonio
