In the case a user presents an issue regarding the specific group with which he wish to confront himself, he will choose the <font color="red">local</font> option inside the virtual parliament he prefers to attend. The application will assign to his motion a number of an inner protocol.

In the case instead that the user wishes to present an issue for the whole planetary agorà, he will choose the <font color="red">global</font> option:

<br><br><br>

For as regards the allocation of a protocol number to an issue, there exists the possibility that this number be furnished automatically by a server or by assigned persons. We hope that this process be almost all completely automatic, without the intervention of anybody, in order to avoid every bureaucratic slowing.

It is easy however that a same issue is presented more than once, or that will be presented slightly different issues. In this way the deliberational process could meet various difficulties too. But as a general interest exists that a specific theme gains the widest participation and consensus, we can foresight that the various promoters could use this same system, of proposition, confrontation and deliberation that here we are dreaming of, in order to determine which of these proposals, or which conclusive proposal, should be at last lead ahead.
