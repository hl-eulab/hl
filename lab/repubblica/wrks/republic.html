Republic and Democracy. What are they, and what is the relationship that binds them? Democracy is defined as that societal order in which the People rise as the Sovereign and give life to a Republic: a national co-ownership constituted of codes, bodies, and institutions; of assets, property, and resources; of positions, powers, and revenues. A common patrimony—economic, legal, political—to be cared for in solidarity and enjoyed equally. This can occur simultaneously, if that specific part of the res publica allows it: as in the case of a public garden. Or by succeeding one another pro tempore: as is necessary for a public position, power, or role. All to maintain the ownership of the asset in the hands of the People.

  </p><p>

Democracy is a harmonious society, contrasted with the conflicted mass of tyranny: be it empire, monarchy, or anything else. In tyranny, the People are subjected to the few who perpetually hold the central power, and to their favored ones. In Democracy, people can access the nucleus of the societal cell—the Republic—through an Institute such as the Public Jobs Bank, which periodically redistributes it according to competence, suitability, and preparation. Anyone can lead an active public life and become the architect of their own destiny. Society gains from this by enjoying a broad vision, enriched by each individual, enabling it to seize opportunities and overcome obstacles.

  </p><p>

In summary: one lives in a Democracy if the People enjoy a Republic. If there exists a Public Jobs Bank (in which anyone can register and enlist to contribute) that enables the periodic, regular renewal of the personnel managing the public affair. If this Institute is not in force, then both "democracy" and "republic," though declared, though brandished, though vaunted, are fictitious. These are forms kept confused, intermediate, spurious, by those who, enjoying undue privileges, do not wish to renounce them and employ every agency and means at their disposal—primarily educational and informational ones—to keep the People unaware and in a state of subjugation.
