>Kind Sirs of the DEMOGRAPHIC-LIST,

>I'm appreciating very much your work, and for this reason today I would 
>share with you this reflection:
>
>
>In order for another world to become a possibility
>
>In present human societies, in which the most important, the most 
>strategic roles encompassing organization, administration, finance, 
>education, culture, information, health and public safety, are assigned 
>for life to certain persons, as a matter of fact the State lives well far 
>from the common Citizens. The State appears like an impenetrable hard 
>stone, at all immodifiable by those who where excluded from it. These two 
>entities, State and Citizens, that for social pact should coincide, should 
>be one only thing, as a matter of fact remain separated and often opposed.
>
>It is often written in the constitutions of the countries of the world 
>that "sovereignty belongs to the people" (meaning to all the people!), but 
>the reality is vastly different. Most of the countries of the world 
>literally belong to those persons who are assumed for life in the key 
>positions of the State, whether they are representatives or their 
>subordinates. Present nations are in the hands of a real oligarchy --of a 
>low level but spread everywhere-- that still lords and subject in a 
>subtle, sly manner the remaining part of the population. Nations are so 
>prevented from a natural evolution towards that the various situational 
>ambits indeed demand.
>
>If we are not in agreement with our government's policies, do not lose 
>other time: concentrate our energies toward removing that particular model 
>of social organization, which is the basis for every harmful behaviour of 
>the Governments, and which gives full power to multinational corporations 
>and economic empires. Public Employment for Life is the deep, hidden, mean 
>origin of the majority of the world's problems, be they in ecology, human 
>rights, peace or the economy, or in any other area.
>
>Demand, therefore, for what it is impossible to deny the absolute 
>legitimacy: claim for rotation of Public Employment, so that it can become 
>equally shared and of real common belonging. On the day in which this new 
>social system would come to the fore, no longer, for example, public 
>forces (persons that today are also them assumed for life, becoming so 
>faithful keepers of oligarchyc States) will rage against the 
>demonstrators. The seeds of a new society, without monopolization and 
>exclusion, based instead on equal sharing and full participation by all, 
>will take root. On that day even such ambitious aims as to see every 
>woman, every man on Earth having a work, and therefore an income, minimum 
>guaranted, will become much more easily attainable.
>
>Public Employment for Life is the weak ring of an otherwise indestructible 
>chain that binds a whole world and keeps it from achieving social progress 
>and justice. Public Employment for Life is the ring that today, in the 
>interest of all, we must definitively break.
