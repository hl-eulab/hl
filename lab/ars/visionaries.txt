Subject: In order for another world to become a possibility

Kind Visionaries,

I'm appreciating very much your work, and for this reason today I would share with you this reflection:


In order for another world to become a possibility

In present human societies, in which the most important, the most strategic roles encompassing organization, administration, finance, education, culture, information, health and public safety, are assigned for life to certain persons, as a matter of fact the State lives well far from the common Citizens. The State appears like an impenetrable hard stone, at all immodifiable by those who where excluded from it. These two entities, State and Citizens, that for social pact should coincide, should be one only thing, as a matter of fact remain separated and often opposed.

It is often written in the constitutions of the countries of the world that "sovereignty belongs to the people" (meaning to all the people!), but the reality is vastly different. Most of the countries of the world literally belong to those persons who are assumed for life in the key positions of the State, whether they are representatives or their subordinates. Present nations are in the hands of a real oligarchy --of a low level but spread everywhere-- that still lords and subject in a subtle, sly manner the remaining part of the population. Nations are so prevented from a natural evolution towards that the various situational ambits indeed demand.

If we are not in agreement with our government's policies, do not lose other time: concentrate our energies toward removing that particular model of social organization, which is the basis for every harmful behaviour of the Governments, and which gives full power to multinational corporations and economic empires. Public Employment for Life is the deep, hidden, mean origin of the majority of the world's problems, be they in ecology, human rights, peace or the economy, or in any other area. 

Demand, therefore, for what it is impossible to deny the absolute legitimacy: claim for rotation of Public Employment, so that it can become equally shared and of real common belonging. On the day in which this new social system would come to the fore, no longer, for example, public forces (persons that today are also them assumed for life, becoming so faithful keepers of oligarchyc States) will rage against the demonstrators. The seeds of a new society, without monopolization and exclusion, based instead on equal sharing and full participation by all, will take root. On that day even such ambitious aims as to see every woman, every man on Earth having a work, and therefore an income, minimum guaranted, will become much more easily attainable.

Public Employment for Life is the weak ring of an otherwise indestructible chain that binds a whole world and keeps it from achieving social progress and justice. Public Employment for Life is the ring that today, in the interest of all, we must definitively break.

Please, severely criticize these words. If the concept remains still valid, then develop and divulge it around yourself.

Many thanks,
