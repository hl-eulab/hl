<br><br><br>

Among the many innovations that today are necessary in our way of living, at least one relates to the Public Employment. There are some works that, for their common utility, or for the administration of common goods and services, or for the security of all (i.e. education, health, municipal, provincial, regional, state employments, civil protection, police, financial guard, defense, etc. etc.) are categorized under the name of public employments: they serve the collectivity and the whole collectivity uses them.

<br><br>

As we all know, today the public employment is committed to people choosen through particular procedures that intend to select the most qualified, among the many who would like to carry it out. Once the most qualified people are selected, it is a habit to assign them to the employment at hand for the entire duration of their life. Well: even if this is a custom which by now has been deep-rooted for a long time, under the light of a wider awareness widely offered to us by the mass media, it is possible, today, to see clearly many reasons to think that this use should change.

<br><br>

We should consider that, the available jobs being very few in comparison to, not only the applicants, but, thing much more important, the qualified people, what we assign to those that are chosen is, practically, not as much a job as a real privilege in comparison to the rest of the society, a privilege that is in any case of totally unjustified origin. If we recognize the society, in its wholeness, to be depositary of the right to benefit of the public goods and services, in the same way we must give it the right of fair participation to the administration and execution of these goods and services.

<br><br>

When the public employment was born, determined jobs suddenly began to be assigned to determined people in a univocal correspondence. In a totally natural manner, in fact, it was perpetuated the classic scheme of spontaneus work. A person beginning a working activity easily developed a certain fidelity to it, and continued it, excepted it be, beyond the end of his own life through his successive generations. It was extremely simple, therefore, to wed the public employment to this same system. Beyond this, certainly and unfortunately, there was afterwards also an embitterment of this conception. An exasperation occurred caused by the phoenomenon of the so called "favouritism", in which the life commitment of a job guaranteed a loyalty of equal duration to the politician that assigned it. Other than aggravating the situation in general, this phoenomenon has contributed greatly to the retarding of the taking awareness that in reality the work of public utility cannot be of exclusive property of anyone, justly for its very definition of public activity. Until now we have conceived this definition only in a sense: that everyone can profit of its services. Today, with the situation of tremendous disparity that has been created in the field of occupation and revenues of population, and with the clear and global vision of the social picture that the mass media continuosly furnishes us, we cannot not become aware that the public employment must be considered public from all the points of view, including its assignment and execution.

<br><br>

We need, in short, as soon as possible, to take in serious consideration the idea to abolish that which today clearly appears to be the iniquitous privilege of public employment assigned to few elected for their whole life. On the contrary, we need to create a more equitable distribution among all those who wish to work and demonstrate to have the necessary requisites. An extremely important as well as simple task waits for us: to count the hours of work needful to the good acting of our nation, then to count the number of available and idoneous people, and at last equitably distribute the first among the second.

<br><br><br>

We should consider, after, other than that could seem a pure question of theoretic equity, that introducing such a reform, things inside our Country would begin working very better under various aspects.

<br><br>

First of all, the introduction of an intelligent rotation of the staff of employers inside the public structures would immediately bring a flow of fresh creative energy. The public structure would be removed from that condition of eternal immobility that all of us widely verify, and that is mainly due to the sense of exclusive property that every employé, of every level, today attributes to "his" employ. Every new dependent would bring his own original contribute, different from every other, introducing a creative and productive capacity without equals, long a line of constant renewal and improvement. Besides this, those who were substitute from others, would have the opportunity to regain strengths and to reinvigorate their spirit. Not only this: they could, more easily, keep constantly adjourned their technical preparation, and even develope other interests and private activities, setting on the basis for a comprehensively better life, over all for themselves. The low race of the tired, extinguished, bored public dependents, without the hope of a changing future, and for this reason better, would disappear forever, making room to an always fresh, joyful, attentive, accurate and efficacious army of public workers.

<br><br>

Another thing that we should consider, after, is that, in the case we introduce in our Country the reform of the Fair Public Employment, a manifest sense of justice and a spirit of instinctive co-operation would spread itself suddenly inside our society. We would see the disappearing of that climate of reciprocal mistrust that oppresses all of us in a various measure, now for long time, that mistrust caused just by situations similar to this, here described, for disparity, injustice and unreasonableness. Besides this, we would see the falling of that distinction between state and citizen that today easily tends to separate us from institutions, that same distinction that rises from the fact that to be from a part and from the other of the wickets of the public offices are always the same faces. Make turns behind public wickets and writing-desks and to put on periodically different uniforms, would let us to verify in first person the efficaciousness and the value of our method and work and, when opportune, timely bring the necessary corrections. Would exist no more oppressors from a part and from the other part the oppressed, but everyone could experiment these two different conditions and provide to make them both disappear. The new situation that would rise would keep us always clear in mind and would put in practice that theory, predicated by many but practiced by few, that affirms that we all are the state, not only someone, and no one excluded.

<br><br>

No longer being the public employment exclusive property of few privileged, but right and, in a certain way, even a duty of all of us, no longer existing the personal interest to dim our sight, it would at last appear clear that we must see the public employment overall like a reciprocal service and only secondarily like a job, like a personal source of gain. We must put in second plain the remunerative component of public employment, and emphasize instead its religious component, in the sense, naturally, more literal, truthful, and exquisite of the term: like something that unites us, offering to everyone a benefit that is directly proportional to our capacity to aggregate ourselves (we remember that the word religion has good probabilities of derivating from latin re-ligare: to unite together).

<br><br>

Certainly, carrying into effect the reform of the Fair Public Employment, the retribution pro-capite deriving from, and proportional to, the own contribute to society would initially be inferior to that perceived from the public dependent of today. This, however, far from being a negative fact, would permit us to become aware of the effective wealth of our Country, once it is equally distributed. We would see prevented useless wastings and vain expenses by few elects, while it will be permitted a wider diffusion of a sound wellbeing, sound because balanced under all the aspects. The lower rent deriving from the growth of the number of persons among them the public pie will be divided, will be for us not as an obstacle, but as a spur in order to concentrate ourselves on the ways fit to generate authentic wealth: to lavish a greater energy and enthusiasm, personal and collective, in the research (cultural and scientific), and dedicate ourselves in a greater number to it, in order to conquer a higher degree of knowledge and a more refined technology that leads us to resources and wealths very superior to our necessities.

<br><br>

To quit the system of unjustified privileges, distributing equally the work of public utility and relative remuneration: this is one of the most important and decisive task to which we must engage ourselves in the coming years, if we want to establish the basis for a sound, constructive and therefore even pleasant living.

<br><br>

If you find yourself in frank harmony with a reform like the Fair Public Employment, do not wait to hear speaking of it on the radio, televisions and newspapers: long time will be spent before such an awareness could blossom until this point. Instead, busy yourself, developing and divulging around yourself the ideas contained inside this Call for an evolution of Public Employment.
