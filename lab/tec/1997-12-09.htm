Dear Sirs,

I send you my best and kind greetings!

I wish signal you the "Earth Calendar for the Space Era", a new kind
of civil calendar realized in the Eudaemony global research Laboratory
whose I'm the founder.


The Earth Calendar is essentially a new educational tool that aims:

- to favour a greater awareness and evolutional development both in
the individual and in societies.

- to favour the spreading of a universal culture that go beyond and
complete, respecting them amply, local memories and cultures.

- to favour, both in the indiviual and in society, a look toward the
future that permit us to better define e succeed our goals.

In order to reach that, the Earth Calendar introduces numerous and
substanzial novelties to the calendar that we commonly use in the
western world:

- the years reckoning starts again from zero, to indicate a single
turning point in the history of this Planet, choosing as a reference
point a great cultural and scientific achievement and mankind's
inheritance. 

- every week day is dedicated to the nurturing of a positive quality
of the human soul, whose development results in indisputable benefits
both to the individual and the community. 

- dates that indicate special astronomical events of universal
importance are declared Holidays and subsequently celebrated. 

- the names of days of the week and months of the year are changed in
order to give them a greater rational, emotional and universal power. 


As you can immediately see, going at:

our is something more than a simple proposal, the matter being an
already perfectly utilizable everywhere calendar. And in effect our
initiative is already liked by many futurists and thinkers as well as
by many international people on the Net.

The Earth Calendar is also widely illustrated with the wonderful
art-works of famous Astro-Visionary-New Age artists.

I hope having done a welcome action to signal you this initiative.

Kind regards,

Danilo D'Antonio
