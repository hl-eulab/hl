Dear future-listers have a look at

http://oasi.asti.it/Homes/eudemonia/calene.htm

"Danilo D'Antonio" <dasa3000@mondrian.sgol.it>  developed it and he is an
italian futurist

it is a brillinat idea and one i support absolutely spot on an most worthwhile

prey tell when do we start

you involve spirity and critique and tolerance and concern re the present
trends so at last lets start cretating our own futures ones we can hold on
to in the onslaught of the overbearing sameness creeping up on us today

please try to have a look at it and maybe support it if you wish

ciao paul w
