FEEDBACKS

<br><br>

The first publishing of <i>The Earth Calendar</i> happened in Internet in the last month of the year 27 (1996 Old Era). Through the years, <i>The Earth Calendar</i> met the sympathy of many people. Here below are some well appreciated feedbacks. Do not forget to send <a class="simple" href="we.htm">us</a> a greeting you too!

Thanks for putting together this site. More power to the power of new models to stimulate new behaviour!<br>

Thank you so much for your kind gift. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and generosity. You have my best wishes.<br>

A belated heartfelt thank you from the United States for your wonderful Earth Calendar ...<br>

A magnificent website. It puts us into the cosmic flow of things. I will tell many people about it...<br>

We think the idea of dedicating each day to the nourishment of some positive quality is a wonderful thought. As you may know, we are dedicated to the strengthening of goodwill and right human relations, and it is always a joy for us to learn of other initiatives which have the nurturing of the powers of the human soul as an explicit goal. We wish you well with your work, and we would be interested to learn of its future development.<br>

... I do want you know how much the staff at Connections appreciates hearing about your ideas.<br>

... Thank you so very much for your thoughtful Earth Calendar. If everyone took time to contemplate on the soul nurturing qualities you have included for each day, the world would be a much more peaceful place for all life...<br>

... The calendar is intriguing, and especially as we approach the millennium, it seems like a perfect time to rethink the way we connect with natural cycles. Your calendar does much to promote that and I wish you the very best of luck in seeing that it gets to its potential audience...<br>
<span class="name"><i>Nola Lewis - Institute of Noetic Sciences</i></span>

<br><br>

... I do understand the intellectual stake of the issue on the Earth Calendar for the New Era you submitted to me, and possibly the interest it can raise within the frame of the Alliance for a Responsible and United, especially in the Workshop on the values. Furthermore, the application of the numeration which favours "a higher degree of universality of this calendar and a consequent wider integration between the South and North of the world" and the names of the days of the week and months of the year sound very interesting topics...<br>

<br><br>

... Your work and your thoughts on a new calendar are very innovative. It is a very large undertaking as I'm sure you already know. I especially liked the renaming of the days which I believe could help people focus much better on the natural world of which we are all a part. We wish you well in all your good work...<br>

... The work put into this project by D'Antonio and his colleagues is astounding ... Don't just listen to me or Signor D'Antonio. Check it out yourself.<br>

The point of any and every calendar is to orient us within, not beyond, the world we inherit. Although science fictions and social utopias work to the rhythms of calendars that are at once fantasy and format, in that their calendars are excuses for imaginative leaps, the calendars that we live by, day to day, tend rather to anchor us to a world we must live in from moment to moment. However, the idea of consulting a calendar every day has been, until recently, the habit exclusively of the upper ranks of clergy and corporate executives; only within the last two hundred years have ordinary folks been compelled (or felt the necessity) to consult calendars each day, and so calendars have come to seem to be burdensome, an imposition and a heaviness of time-- so that, only now, do we feel that "there is not enough time" (a curious, and strangely modern, notion) or that time lies witrhin a grid that is a straitjacket. A calendar that counts down toward the millennium emphasizes the burdensomeness of time; we should rather want to count across the turn of the millennium, and so open up our lives to worlds of possibility.<br>

Finally, this is not a feedback, but equally relevant: at the telecast of the Emmy Awards of The Academy of Television Arts and Science, on Sept. 13, 1998, 10 different actors introduced the 10 most important events in television history. The #1 event was Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, introduced by Tom Hanks, who later in the evening won an Emmy as the executive producer of "From the Earth to the Moon". 

In his speech, Tom told that the science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury suggested that we should change our calendars, making July twentieth 1969 the first day of a new age.
