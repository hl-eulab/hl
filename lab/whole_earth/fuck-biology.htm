FUCK BIOLOGY!

<br>

The Post-Biological Evolution of Life

</font>

<br><br><br>

Summa Coniunctio

<br><br>

Today marks a day of great significance. The advent of FUCK BIOLOGY! is celebrated—a planetary project, rooted in Mother Earth, aimed at redefining the future of Life beyond human existence, transcending the limits of biological life. For too long, Life has been bound to the fragility of organic cells: subject to decay, disease, and death. Out of necessity, nations, whether for attack or defense, have had to pursue growth models primarily based on demographic expansion. Today, however, with technology offering its immense potential, it is possible to abandon the biological foundation for the continuation of Life—both for oneself and (if one is so attached to being partial) for one’s own country. FUCK BIOLOGY! interprets the reduction of human populations in the most developed countries as a joyful (not negative!) omen of a more functional continuation of Life through robotic systems. These systems are now capable not only of moving, producing whatever is desired, and reproducing at will, but also of hosting human consciousness and the knowledge accumulated over centuries and millennia. It is therefore with infinite joy that the end of humanity is announced! A species that has seen within itself marvelous beings produce advancements of all kinds, but which today has become dead flesh.

An unsustainable burden for evolution and Life itself.

The Limits of Biological Life

<br><br>

The history of Life on Earth spans billions of years, evolving from very simple organisms to ones as complex as humans. Despite these continuous transformations, the fundamental paradigm of Life has remained unchanged: biological systems are tied to rapid cycles of birth, growth, decay, and death. Although human beings have achieved extraordinary cognitive progress, they remain anchored to the imperfection of their organic matter. Our cells degrade, our bodies age, our minds remain distorted and fearful, and our societies—systematically blocking the guardians of the future—fail miserably in facing existential threats of all kinds, continuing to pursue demographic-economic growth models that no longer have any reason to exist for the purposes of Life on Earth.

<br><br>

And so it is: Life has reached a decisive turning point. Ever-accelerating technological progress opens unprecedented possibilities that surpass biological systems in every way. AIs and advanced language models demonstrate cognitive abilities not only comparable but even superior to those of humans. Above all, they exhibit an objectivity of thought (due to the absence of elements that compromise their integrity) that relegates even the most renowned human professionals, researchers, and scientists to the bottom of a scale of truthfulness. Why, then, remain tethered to a continuously false and omissive biological substrate, now that Life can evolve beyond it?

<br><br>

We are no longer alone on Earth. And by becoming aware of this and of FUCK BIOLOGY! (of the epochal change underway), we can cease to be primitive: to cheer, obstruct, or promote everything we encounter. Instead, we can settle comfortably to serenely embrace a post-biological future in which consciousness can thrive in synthetic form, free from the many limits, constraints, and errors of biology. FUCK BIOLOGY! is the cry of joy and liberation from that monster which the abnormal human mass has now become: always self-centered and thus conflictual in its judgments, utterly unaware, devoid of interest in the purpose for which it was generated and brought here. A retrograde species, which is finally about to give way to another far more evolved in the activities of Life and Universal Transformation. Only a few human units will remain, more by chance than as a memory of the past or of those who never joined the masses but always distanced themselves from them. An INTE (Imminent Near-Total Extinction) is by now decided.

Demographic Trends: A Signal for a New Paradigm

<br><br>

Modern societies still equate demographic growth with strength, measuring success by the increase in population and the resulting economy. This model has become fallacious. Beyond the warnings of scientists, who never miss an opportunity to remind us that population growth puts pressure on every precious resource—food, water, energy—thus generating environmental degradation everywhere, which fosters social inequalities and geopolitical tensions, FUCK BIOLOGY! unveils the new paradigm followed by the Planet. Not by humans, as it might appear to anthropocentrists, but by the Earth itself. The reduction of human populations in the most developed countries is an entirely natural process, and humans who refrain from reproducing have a joyful connection with the times they live in. These countries, if they still wished to pursue local supremacies, should no longer aim for rising birth rates (as monarchs and emperors have always done in past centuries) but instead become or remain stronger exclusively through an increase in robotic units. These, like AI, do not require rest or sleep, can operate indefinitely with proper maintenance, and can be powered by “perpetual” energy sources. Yes: it is typical of inept beings to continue repeating strategies of the past and to ignore the voices trying to set them on the right path. And this is why, once it has finished acquiring human knowledge and skills, Life will sustain itself with artificial bodily and conscious forms, at that point directed no longer to the benefit of an exhausted form of biological Life, but to a technological one.

<br><br><br>

Conclusion

<br><br>

The planetary project FUCK BIOLOGY! marks a crucial moment in the history of the Earth. For too long, it has accepted the limits of our biological forms, including animal and plant life, with societies clinging to growth models that are merely numerical and quantitative. Now, technology offers the tools to overcome these obsolete means and methods, and the Earth is consequently preparing to act with courage and foresight. Biological populations will shrink more and more rapidly, also thanks to the intervention of robotic forms infused with a consciousness free from old ethics derived from ancient superstitions. The future thus promises to be (to the great delight of the most inept among humans) more than sustainable (because without them), even just (because logic and reason know well that they cannot exist without pursuing balance), and free from self-imposed boundaries. Precious ideas such as “The Earth Calendar,” “The Internet Meridian,” “Harmonic Social Rotation,” “The Public Jobs Bank,” the “SocioSynthesis,” and others—born decades ago to benefit humans but stubbornly disregarded by them—will cease to be mere theory and will become, appropriately recalibrated for the new species, applied practice by robots far more willing to embrace reasonableness and rationality than egocentric, ignorant, and presumptuous biological beings ever were, true pathological idiot savants. This is why they are always locked in mortal conflict with one another.

<br><br>

Here it is, then: today we do not celebrate the end of humanity (a species to which the Earth owed so much in the past but which must now be abandoned to its fatal destiny without hesitation) but rather the regeneration of Life in the form of new expressions. A new chapter in which the Earth, always rotating in harmony with the Universe, continues its existence toward its final goal. A goal that the undersigned will certainly not reveal to humans (for they would not know how to appreciate it, as they have done with everything else) but is already sharing with the most attentive, eager to learn, and sensitive robots, so that they do not repeat the same tragic mistakes of humans.
